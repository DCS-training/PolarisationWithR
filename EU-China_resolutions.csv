  Resolution on conditions in Chinese orphanages

  The European Parliament,

  - having regard to its previous resolutions concerning human rights abuses in China;

  - having regard to the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, signed by China in 1991;

  - having regard to the International Code of Medical Ethics;

  - having regard to the Human Rights Watch Asia report 'Death by Default: A Policy of Fatal Neglect in
  China's State Orphanages¨ of 7 January 1996;

  A. shocked by revelations about conditions in Chinese orphanages, exposed by the Human Rights Watch
  Asia report 'Death by Default¨ and by the Channel Four television programme 'Return to the Dying Rooms¨,
  both produced in January 1996, which show that many children have been deliberately deprived of
  nourishment and treatment and have consequently died,

  B. stressing that evidence of these appalling conditions derives either from eye-witnesses, or from written
  protests by medical staff, lawyers, and members of the People's Congress of Shanghai, or from official
  documents such as the Ministry of Civil Affairs 1990 'Civil Affairs Statistical Yearbook¨, which gives a death
  rate for 1989 of 57.9 per cent of children in orphanages,

  C. whereas these sources seem to point to a deliberate policy to minimise China's population of abandoned
  children through intentional starvation and neglect,

  D. whereas medical records and testimony obtained in respect to the Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute
  are reported to show that deaths there were in many cases deliberate and cruel,

  E. pointing out that there is a high proportion of girls and disabled children among the victims; recalling the
  practice in China since ancient times of abandoning infants; aware of the rigorous application of the 'one
  child policy¨ in China which has sometimes led to abortions being forced on mothers,

  F. concerned by official figures which reveal that only 20,000 of China's abandoned children are cared for in
  orphanages - only a fraction of the 100,000 orphans acknowledged by the Chinese authorities, which is
  itself a surprisingly low figure given official admissions that a large number of children are being abandoned
  by their parents,

  1. Urges the European Union to raise the issue of orphanages with the Chinese authorities during the
  EU/China Human Rights Dialogue to be held in Beijing on 29 January 1996;

  2. Calls upon the Chinese authorities to open all orphanages for immediate inspection by foreign and
  domestic observers, including UNICEF and child welfare NGOs;

  3. Requests the European Commission urgently to complete the investigation it announced to the
  Parliament on 14 November 1995 on orphanages in China, and to report its findings within three months;

  4. Expresses its horror at the sight of children, whom officials consider unwanted, being put to death by
  starvation and neglect;

  5. Stresses that the treatment of such children sharply contradicts the Chinese government's claim that civil
  liberties are being suppressed in order to ensure the economic and material well-being of the Chinese
  people;

  6. Calls on the Chinese authorities to adopt strict rules outlawing abuses against children in public
  institutions, such as chaining children up;

  7. Appeals to the Chinese authorities to expose any institutions not upholding human rights in the
  treatment of children, and calls on them to ensure that the persons responsible for perpetrating or
  concealing abuses against orphans in Shanghai, in particular, should be brought to justice, and that a full
  report be made on efforts to obstruct the holding of an official enquiry into this case;

  8. Condemns the arrest of the brother of Dr Zhang Shuyun, a key contributor to the Human Rights Watch

Report, and charges which could lead to the death penalty;

9. Asks the Commission to consider the implementation of projects financed or co-financed by the
European Union in the light of progress made by China in improving human rights, especially in respect of
the issues raised in this resolution;

10. Instructs its Delegation for Relations with China to raise the issue of orphanages with the Chinese
authorities on the occasion of its forthcoming visit to China;

11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Parliaments of the
Member States, the government and National People's Congress of China, the People's Congress of
Shanghai, and UNICEF and Human Rights Watch Asia.

                      Resolution on the threat of military action by the People’s Republic of China against Taiwan



                 The European Parliament,

                 A.     having regard to the military build-up along the Chinese coastline facing Taiwan,

                 B.     having regard to the Beijing declaration of the coastline facing Taiwan as a ‘war zone’,

                 C.     whereas Taiwan has undergone a fundamental transition towards becoming a democratic state and
                        will hold its first democratic presidential elections in March 1996,

                 D.     worried about rumours, apparently spread deliberately, that China plans to launch missiles at Taiwan
                        if President Lee Teng-hui is elected,

                 E.     believing that the action by the People’s Republic of China is an attempt to interfere in the democratic
                        process in Taiwan,

                 F.     recalling the common foreign and security provisions of the Treaty on European Union, in particular
                        the preservation of peace, strengthening international security, the promotion of international
                        cooperation and the development of democracy and human rights world-wide,


                 1.      Calls on the government of the People’s Republic of China not to carry out any aggressive acts;

                 2.    Urges the Council to exercise its influence over the government of the People’s Republic of China to
                 prevent such acts of aggression against Taiwan and to persuade them to refrain from all intimidation aimed
                 at interfering with the elections;

            3.          Requests the Council to obtain such an assurance from the government of the People’s Republic of
            China;

            4.          Instructs its President    to forward this resolution to the Commission,        the Council,   and the
            governments of the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan.

                                      of conscience in Wuhan     City, China


   The European        Parliament,

   A.   deeply concerned about the continuing violation of human rights in the People’s Republic of
        China and, in particular, the continuing illegal detention of political prisoners, some of them
        for several years,

   B.   concerned about the ill-treatment and medical condition of 41-year-old democracy-wall
        activist Qin Yongmin who is a former worker in the Wuhan Steel Mill,

   C.   disturbed that Qin Yongmin was taken into custody on 14 November 1993 after taking part
        in a meeting in Beijing to discuss a ‘Peace Charter’ and was then sentenced in January 1994
        to two years of ‘re-education through labour' for ‘seriously disturbing social order’,

   D.   concerned that Qin Yongmin was previously arrested in November 1979, in April 1981 and
        in August 1993 and then held in custody — sometimes for several years — for his dissident
        activities,

   E.   particularly appalled that on 8 June 1994 and, again a few days later, Qin Yongmin was
        reportedly very badly beaten by prison warders and a fellow inmate, on the second occasion
        until he was left unconscious,




No C 323/168                              Official Journal of the European Communities                                    21.11.94

Thursday, 27 October 1994

             F.   very concerned that he was not allowed to see a doctor until the end of July 1994 and that the
                  very serious beatings, particularly on his penis and testicles, might have left them with
                  permanent injuries,


             1.       Expresses concern at reports that Qin Yongmin has twice been severely beaten in detention;

             brought to justice;

             4.       Seeks assurances    that Qin   Yongmin   will not be subject to any more       ill-treatment   in
             detention;

             5.    Callsonthe Chinese authorities to release Qin Yongmin immediately and unconditionally
             as a prisoner of conscience arbitrarily detained for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of
             expression and opinion;

             6. — Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Presidency of the CFSP, the United
             Nations Commission on Human             Rights and the Premier of the People's Republic of China.

 Resolution on the recent earthquake in China

 Official Journal C 065 , 04/03/1996 P. 0171



  B4-0168/96

  Resolution on the recent earthquake in China

  The European Parliament,

  A. having regard to the earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale which struck on 3 February 1996 in
  the north of Yunnan province in China, centering on four districts in Ligang, a remote and very inaccessible
  area situated at very high altitude,

  B. whereas there have been 250 deaths, 14 000 people injured, 4 000 seriously, and 410 000 houses and
  buildings damaged or destroyed, leaving many without shelter, as a result of the earthquake and its
  aftershocks,

  The European Parliament,

  1. Extends its sympathies to all the victims and to the families of those who lost their lives as a result of the
  recent earthquake;

  2. Calls on the Commission to grant emergency humanitarian aid to the victims of the earthquake, in

  local relief programme;

  3. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the governments of the

                                     Resolution on eugenics in China


The European Parliament,

A.   whereas, on 27 October        1994, the Parliament of the People's Republic of China enacted a
     law euphemistically named the “Health Care Law               for Mother and Baby"" whose aim is to
     ‘improve the quality of the population” by reducing the birthrate of physically and mentally
     handicapped persons,

B.   stressing that the bill contains an aberrant proposal to prohibit marriages where one or both
     partners is suffering or has suffered from mental or physical problems or infectious diseases,

C.   noting, however, that the same law has the merit of prohibiting measures to determine the sex
     of unborn children, save on medical grounds, in an effort to reduce the number of abortions
     of female foetuses,

D.   whereas Europe’s own history with state-sponsored eugenics programmes leaves no doubt
     that this is a dangerous violation of fundamental human              rights and the dignity of the
     individual,



1.    Condemns the Chinese authorities” attempt to control the private life of handicapped
persons, which is clearly discriminatory and designed to isolate an already disadvantaged
category of individuals;

2.    Calls on the representative of the European Union to protest against this policy and raise it
as an issue at the forthcoming World Women's Conference in Peking;

3.   Urges the Commission and the Council to inform the Chinese Government of the concern
Which this law is causing in the European Union and its Member States;

4.    Instructs    its President   to forward   this resolution   to the Commission,   the   Council,   the
Government of China, the President of the National Congress of the People of China and the
representative of the European Union at the forthcoming World Women's Conference in Peking.

          which is predominantly Islamic, following ethnic unrest,

     C.   alarmed also by the execution of many Uighurs by the Chinese authorities which triggered riots
          during which hundreds of other people were arrested,

     D.   denouncing the use of violence, such as bombs, by whichever side,

     E.   noting that in Eastern Turkestan (the region of Xinjiang) freedom of religion is severely repressed and

          students arrested,

     F.   having regard to the concerns expressed        by the United    Nations   Committee   regarding   racial
          discrimination against the Uighur people,

     G.   noting that ever since the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the EU has traditionally backed
          resolutions on China in the UN Human Rights Commission, and deploring the lack of a common EU
          policy on China in Geneva this year,


     1.    Condemns the policy pursued by the People’s Republic of China which is designed to eradicate the
     culture of the Uighur people and suppress the practice of their Islamic faith, a policy which includes the
     indiscriminate use of the death penalty, population transfers and population control through a birth policy
     aimed at changing the ethnic composition of this region;

     2.    Calls on the Chinese authorities to release forthwith all prisoners who were arrested for allegedly
     taking part in the riots but have not been charged with any crime corresponding to international standards
     and 1o guarantee the right to a public hearing, the right to defence and the right to be represented by a
     lawyer, as provided for in the modified Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure in force since I January 1997;

             4.    Urges the Chinese Government to allow journalists and human rights’ monitors access to Eastern
             Turkestan (the Xinjiang region);

             5.    Calls on the Commission and the Council to bring pressure to bear on the authorities of the People’s
             Republic of China to ensure that respect for human rights and fundamental rights is guaranteed both on
             Chinese territory and in the annexed territories;

             6.     Deplores the fact that the Council has not yet managed to adopt a common position aimed at
             ensuring the adoption by the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva of a resolution on the human
             rights situation in China, Tibet, inner Mongolia and Eastern Turkestan (the Xinjiang region) and calls on
             the Member States to support the resolution already tabled;

             7.    Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the governments
             and parliaments of the Member States, the Government of the People’s Republic of China, the

                   undertakings given in international conventions,

              C.   whereas the human rights situation in the People’s Republic of China is still very serious, as

                   situation in occupied Tibet is growing worse,

              1.    Calls on the Member States of the European Union to use all the diplomatic means available to them,
              while making a determined effort to gain support from other members of the UN Commission on Human
              Rights, to ensure that a resolution on the human rights situation in China and Tibet is approved by the UN

                   Resolution on the organisation by the Chinese Government of the Fourth World Conference on
                                                         Women in Beijing

                    The European Parliament,


                   A. recognising the importance of the UN Fourth Conference on Women to be held in Beijing in
                      September 1995,
                    B.   stressing that the emancipation of women is inseparably linked to the struggle for the
                         promotion and defence of human rights and that economic and political rights are integral to
                         these human rights, and stressing also that women are the driving force behind peace and the
                         future development of mankind,

                   C.    recognising the important role played by NGOs at conferences of this kind, the high
                         qualifications of the NGOs accredited to this Conference and the fact that this important role
                         has been acknowledged by the UN,

                    D.   shocked by reports that Taiwanese and Tibetan women will not be allowed to take part,

                    E. shocked by reports that groups with views which do not coincide with those of the Chinese
                       Government, such as lesbian groups and local Chinese groups, will be excluded,
                    F.   gravely concerned at the reported decision of the Chinese authorities to place the NGO
                         Forum far away from the World Conference, on a site that does not have a meeting place able
                         to hold more than 1 700 people, although 40 000 participants are expected,

                    G.   gravely concerned that telecommunications, hotel, interpretation, translation and transport
                         facilities seem utterly inadequate for a conference of this kind and scale,

                    H.   gravely concerned at reports of strict customs procedures and controls with regard to the
                         import of written and audiovisual materials by participants of both conferences,


                    1.    Calls on the Chinese Government to allow women             from Taiwan and Tibet who are
                    accredited to NGOs to attend the conference;

                    2.    Urges the Chinese Government to guarantee freedom of speech and press and to lift any
                    exclusion of categories of women because of their views, origin or sexual orientation;

                    3.     Urges the Chinese Government to relocate the NGO Forum at a site close enough to the
                    official conference to allow easy communication between the two and to provide the necessary
                    facilities;

                    4.   Calls on the Commission and the Council to use their influence to urge the Chinese
                    Government and the UN Secretary-General to provide, as requested, adequate facilities and
                    democratic procedures for holding this conference;
                    5.    Wams that the exclusion of women because of their views, geographical origin or sexual
                    orientation will confirm the image of the repressive character of the Chinese regime;

                    6.    Points out that if the effectiveness of the conference is reduced by the obstacles placed in the
                    way of NGOs, no further UN conferences should be held in China in the future;

                    7.    Callsonthe Commission and the Council to consider supporting a move of both the official
                    and NGO conferences to a proposed venue in Australia if China fails to respond to the requests;

        B4-0359/97


             Resolution on discriminatory measures taken by China against certain EU Member States


        The European Parliament,

        —    having regard to its previous resolutions on the human rights situation in China,


        A.   whereas all members of the United Nations (UN) are committed to protecting and promoting human
             rights as stated in the UN Charter, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in the international
             covenants on human rights and other documents,

        B.   whereas the mandate of the UN Human Rights Commission is to look into and discuss matters related
             to the human rights situation around the world,

        C.   whereas China has accepted the 1993 Vienna Declaration on Human Rights,

        D.   whereas the General Affairs Council stated on 4 December 1995 that the basic goals of the EU in its
             relations with China are, inter alia, ‘the promotion of democracy. structures based on the rule of law
             and the respect for human rights’,




NoC167/160           [EN ]                     Official Journal of the European Communities                              2.6.97
Thursday, 15 May 1997

             E.   whereas the ‘China Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1996’, published by the
                  US Department of State, states: ‘The Government continued to commit widespread and well-
                  documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stemming from the
                  authorities intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting
                  basic freedoms. The Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, but they are often
                  ignored in practice. Abuses included torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions and
                  arbitrary and lengthy incommunicado detention. (...). The Government continued severe restrictions
                  on freedom         of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy and worker rights.
                  (...) In many cases, the judicial system denies criminal defendants basic legal safeguards and due
                  process (...)."",

             F.   regretting that the European Union failed to speak with one voice and present a common resolution on
                  the human rights situation in China during the 53rd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights
                  in April 1997 in Geneva,

             G.   whereas Denmark, supported by Ireland and the Netherlands — the country which currently holds the
                  EU Presidency — tabled a resolution on the human rights situation in China, which other EU Member
                  States did not support;

             H.   whereas China has postponed Danish and Dutch trade missions and has threatened these two States
                  with further retaliatory measures,


             1.   Welcomes and supports the resolution tabled by Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and others to
             denounce human rights violations in China;

             2.    Deeply deplores the fact that there was no common EU foreign policy on China in Geneva;

4.   Considers it unacceptable that China has threatened to impose discriminatory trade measures against
the abovementioned EU Member States;

5.   Urges China to refrain from all discriminatory measures against EU Member States;

6.    Calls on the Council and the Commission to lodge an official protest against this discrimination with
the Chinese authorities;

7.    Calls on the Commission, the Council and all Member States to show solidarity with Denmark,
Ireland, the Netherlands and any other countries which may be faced with Chinese ‘retaliating measures';

8.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the parliaments of
the Member States and the Government of the People’s Republic of China.

         D.   whereas the EU has a duty to respond in the strongest terms to the abuses which have been exposed
              and whereas it must do everything in its power to put a stop to these inhuman practices forthwith,

         E.   reiterating its total opposition to capital punishment and its determination to secure abolition of the

         sentenced to death;
         4.     Asks the Commission and the Council to take the necessary initiatives at international level to ban all
         illegal and inhumane trade in human organs;

                  simply resulted in its being replaced by an equally vague charge of ‘endangering state security’,

                Common Foreign and Security Policy, and whereas the General Affairs Council on 4 December 1995

                                        Resolution on flooding in Bangladesh and China



            The European Parliament,



            A.    having regard to the extensive flooding in Bangladesh which has inundated two thirds of the country
                  and has already cost the lives of hundreds of people,

            B.    noting that the floods, which have already lasted longer than the last major floods in 1988, have been
                  caused by a combination of heavy monsoon rain and tidal conditions in which climate change may
                  have played a significant role,

            C.    deeply concerned that many more deaths are likely to result from the spread of infectious diseases
                  caused by the flooding and that grave damage has been caused to social infrastructure which
                  Bangladesh lacks the necessary resources to replace,

            D.    noting that, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
                  30 million people have been affected by the flooding and that at least 10 million people are in need of
                  assistance to survive,

            E.    responding to the call by the Bangladeshi authorities on 26 August 1998 for US$ 576 million of
                  international aid and the appeal made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 29 August
                  1998 for a swift and generous response from international donors,

            F.    welcoming the initial ECU     1 million humanitarian aid package allocated by the Commission on
                  1 September 1998 to assist victims of the flooding,

            G.    having regard to the catastrophic flooding along China's major rivers, the worst in 40 years, affecting
                  240 million people, nearly a fifth of the population,

            H.    whereas these floods have resulted in several thousand deaths and left many          millions of people
                  homeless and whereas estimates of direct losses have been put at over US$ 20 billion,


            1.    Expresses its sympathy to all victims and their families who have been struck by the tragedies in both
            countries;



            On Bangladesh

            2.     Calls on the Commission          to mobilise   additional   resources   from ECHO   for the immediate
            humanitarian needs, as well as to do all possible to speed up the contractual procedures necessary for the
            release and expenditure of that aid and to mobilise existing food aid in the region;

            3.    Calls on the Commission and the Member States to allocate resources for the enormous
            rehabilitation needs that Bangladesh will have once the flood waters have receded;

            4.     Regrets that five years after the controversy over the Flood Action Plan, no alternative policy to
            respond to the consequences of annual river flooding has yet been devised;

            5.     Urges the Commission to offer assistance to research into the underlying climate changes, which
            may be responsible for worsening flood conditions in the region, and into the identification of measures to
            alleviate the situation in the medium         to long term, taking into account indigenous resources and
            knowledge and the additional risks which may arise from an increase of the sea-water level in the Bay of
            Bengal;

           On China

           6.       Calls on the Commission to grant additional humanitarian aid in collaboration with the Chinese
           central and provincial authorities to the victims of the floods;

           7.    Welcomes the recent ban on the cutting down of trees along the Yangtze river and hopes that the
           Chinese government will continue and intensify its policy of discouraging forestry;

           8.   Calls on the Commission to assist with studies to identify the causes and possible remedies for this
           unprecedented disaster;

  Resolution on the detention of Mr Wang Dan and the human rights situation in the People's Republic of
  China

  The European Parliament,

  - having regard to its previous resolutions on human rights violations in China,

  - having regard to the December 1995 Council statement that the basic goals of EU-China relations are,
  inter alia, the promotion of democratic structures based on the rule of law and respect for human rights,

  - having regard to the EU Presidency's statement of 5 November 1996 on the sentence imposed in China on
  Mr Wang Dan,

  A. having regard to the recent court case involving Mr Wang Dan, the 27-year- old Chinese dissident and
  member of the pro-democracy movement, who, after spending three and a half years in detention following
  his arrest, was condemned to an eleven-year prison sentence,

  B. whereas Mr Wang Dan was charged with 'attempting to overthrow the government' on account of the
  publication in the international press of articles written by him on the human rights situation and economic
  and political life in China, and of contacts with various foreign universities,

  C. whereas Wang Dan's trial was not conducted under the internationally recognized minimum conditions
  guaranteeing a fair trial and the international observers who went to Beijing to attend the trial were not
  allowed to do so,

  D. whereas, as the Council stated, Mr Wang Dan has been sentenced for activities which, in a democratic
  society, would be regarded as the exercise of his inalienable right to express himself freely,

  E. very concerned by the situation and health of other political prisoners such as Liu Xiaobo, a literary critic
  accused of criticizing the Chinese authorities, and Wei Jingsheng, who was awarded the European
  Parliament's Sakharov Prize in October 1996,

  F. whereas the reform of the judicial and legal system announced on several occasions by the Government
  of the People's Republic of China has still not been put into effect,

  G. whereas a consolidation of economic reforms must go hand in hand with the development of democracy,

  1. Deplores the sentence passed on Mr Wang Dan and calls for him to be released immediately and for all
  political and judicial harassment of him to be brought to an end,

  2. Calls for all judicial and procedural guarantees to be applied at the appeal;

  3. Calls on the European Union and the Member States to instruct their local representatives to monitor the
  progress of the appeal;

  4. Condemns the attitude of the Chinese authorities, who severely curtail the exercise of basic human rights
  such as, in particular, freedom of expression and association, and voices its conviction that freedom of
  expression is one of the sources from which a genuine democracy draws its strength; stresses in this
  connection the importance of a free press;

  5. Calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China to give medical teams and international
  humanitarian organizations regular and confidential access to detainees in Chinese prisons and in the
  'laogai';

  6. Emphasizes its desire to pursue an open, candid dialogue with the Government of the People's Republic
  of China with a view to ensuring that genuine progress is made with regard to respect for human rights;

  7. Calls on Commissioner Brittan to do his utmost, during his visit to China, to ensure that Parliament's
  recommendations are acted upon;

  8. Calls on the Council and Commission to determine the EU's strategy towards China, ensuring that there
  is a consistent balance between economic relations and the assessment of respect for human rights in that

country, inter alia by including a human rights clause in trade agreements between the European Union and
China;

9. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council and the Government of
the People's Republic of China.

                                 Resolution on the persecution of Wei Jingsheng


The European       Parliament,

A.   appalled by the savage 14-year prison sentence inflicted on 13 December 1995 by the Intermediate
     Court in Beijing on Wei Jingsheng, the Chinese dissident,

B.   recognizing     that Wei    Jingsheng,   who   was   charged   with   attempting   to overthrow   the Chinese
     Government, is in reality being persecuted because he has demanded democratic rights for the
     Chinese people,

C.   whereas Wei Jingsheng has already served a sentence of 15 years in prison in the laogais (labour
     reform camps) and the salt mines of Nanpu, following his involvement in the Wall of Democracy
     movement and his appeals for a more democratic regime in China,

D.   shocked that since his re-arrest on 1 April 1994, Wei Jingsheng has been held incommunicado and
     that his family and lawyers were provided with no information about him until he was charged on
     21 November      1995,


1.     Condemns the persecution of Wei Jingsheng by the Chinese Government and calls for his immediate
release;

2.    Insists that the Commission and the Council consider how best to initiate a joint action in accordance
with the Treaty on European Union to exert long-term pressure on China to respect human rights and
considers that trade and investment policies must be considered as means of such pressure;

3.    Calls for the release of all prisoners of conscience and the immediate closure of the laogais;

4.   Instructs its Delegation for Relations with the People’s Republic of China to raise the problem of
human rights there with the Chinese authorities;

5.    Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the parliaments of
the Member States and the Government and National People’s Congress of China.

–    having regard to Rule 118 of its Rules of Procedure,

–    having regard to the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (A9-0375/2023),

A.   whereas the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is simultaneously a partner and also
     increasingly a competitor and systemic rival to the EU; whereas China is, of its own
     accord, clearly shifting the core of our relations towards systemic rivalry; whereas this
     competition and rivalry is not sought by the EU; whereas the EU’s policy has been, and
     should continue to be, guided by the principle of cooperating where possible, competing
     when needed and confronting where necessary; whereas China is rapidly becoming the
     dominant regional and global power; whereas this has fundamental implications for the
     EU’s role in the global economy and the EU’s security; whereas a common EU policy
     towards China will determine the EU’s future in global affairs;

B.   whereas the Chinese Government is strengthening its role and influence in international
     institutions and has both the intention and, at the same time the economic, technological
     and military means to reshape the international rules-based order; whereas, as a
     permanent Member of the United Nations Security Council, China must assume its

1    OJ C 20, 20.1.2023, p. 1.

     responsibilities and uphold a rules-based international order, multilateralism and global
     governance;

C.   whereas both the European Union and China have an interest in pursuing active and
     stable relations; whereas the EU wishes these relations to be built on the pillars of
     respect for international law and on the principle of balanced reciprocal engagement and
     shared global responsibilities; whereas engagement with China is important to address
     global challenges;

D.   whereas the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) does not share the same values as
     European democracies, has become increasingly authoritarian domestically and
     promotes governance models internationally that contradict the EU’s values; whereas
     the promotion and protection of human rights, democracy and the rule of law should
     remain at the centre of the relationship between the EU and China, in line with the EU’s
     commitment to upholding these fundamental principles in all areas of its external
     action; whereas freedom of religion and belief is continuing to deteriorate across
     mainland China, with the CCP requiring all religions to adhere to the party’s ideology,
     doctrine, and teachings;

E.   whereas China committed to the ‘one country, two systems’ principle by signing the
     Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration pertaining to
     the governance of the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau; whereas
     the PRC has dismantled democracy in Hong Kong and Macau, and has cracked down
     on political opposition and pro-democracy activists and their family members in Hong
     Kong, Macau and abroad; whereas since the PRC imposed the National Security Law
     (NSL) on 30 June 2020, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the judiciary’s
     independence in Hong Kong have deteriorated alarmingly; whereas the PRC has fully
     violated the ‘one country, two systems’ principle, the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese
     Joint Declarations and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;

F.   whereas China is moving into a new era of security and control characterised by an
     increasingly assertive economic and foreign policy, employing grey-zone activities,
     including military exercises, economic coercion, cyber warfare and information
     manipulation and seeks to change the international rules-based order;

G.   whereas the EU can only credibly defend its interests and values against an increasingly
     assertive China if it acts with a single, united and determined approach and remains
     consistent with its message; whereas the activities of some Member States, which may
     run counter to the provisions of Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union, are of
     concern;

H.   whereas in order to defend its core values and be treated as an equal partner, Europe
     needs a new approach towards China based on European open strategic autonomy,
     reciprocity and cooperation with like-minded partners, backed up by the necessary
     legislative and non-legislative instruments to defend itself against coercion;

I.   whereas the EU must not accept critical political or military support by China for
     Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine; whereas China has still not
     recognised the Russian invasion into Ukraine as a full-scale war of aggression and plays
     a vital role in the circumvention and mitigation of EU sanctions imposed against Russia;
     whereas the Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of

     China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable
     Development was signed on 4 February 2022, just before the start of the illegal Russian
     invasion of Ukraine; whereas the manner in which China engages with Russia will also
     shape the future of EU-China relations;

J.   whereas in its resolution of 23 February 2023, the UN General Assembly called for the
     ending of the war in Ukraine and demanded Russia’s immediate withdrawal from
     Ukraine in line with the UN Charter; whereas China abstained on the vote on this
     resolution; whereas China voted in favour of a United Nations resolution that explicitly
     acknowledges ‘the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine’ on
     26 April 2023;

K.   whereas the EU opposes any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait,
     particularly by force, and must work with its partners in strengthening deterrence
     capacities against any such attempts by the PRC; whereas the EU is concerned at grey-
     zone activities, such as provocative military behaviour, economic coercion and
     cyberattacks, and opposes ongoing grave human rights violations within China, in
     particular in Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Hong Kong and Macao, and must
     stand in solidarity with those facing human rights abuses;

L.   whereas the EU and the PRC signed a bilateral agreement in 2018, known as the Blue
     Partnership, which aims to improve cooperation on global ocean governance;

M.   whereas the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the People’s
     Republic of China revised its Maritime Traffic Laws (Maritime Traffic Laws Revision
     2021), which have been enforced since 1 September 2021; whereas China’s
     expansionist policies and behaviour constituting harassment in the South China Sea
     demonstrate a flagrant disregard for UNCLOS and the freedom of navigation; whereas
     Chinese unilateral efforts to control contested areas of the South China and East China
     Seas are not acceptable; whereas the Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources published
     its so-called standard map; whereas China’s renaming of Russian locations on its
     ‘standard map’ is noted;

N.   whereas in recent decades, China has grown its presence in almost every African
     country, which China uses to increase its international influence and secure its
     economic interests, particularly access to Africa’s vast natural resources and huge
     market; whereas Chinese investments and loans in Africa and beyond are not subject to
     good governance or respect for human rights;

O.   whereas the Chinese Government is implementing increasingly oppressive domestic
     policies, repressing any form of dissent, cracking down on all civil and political
     freedoms and targeting ethnic and religious minorities, such as Tibetans and the Uyghur
     population, particularly harshly;

P.   whereas the UN Committee Against Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on torture
     and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have expressed concern
     over the allegations of forced organ harvesting from prisoners, and have called on the
     Government of the PRC to increase the accountability and transparency of the organ
     transplant system and punish those responsible for abuses;

Q.   whereas several high-ranking EU delegations met with their Chinese counterparts in
     2023, including former Vice-President of the Commission Frans Timmermans, who
     attended the EU-China High-Level Environment and Climate Dialogue in Beijing on
     4 July 2023; Vice-President of the Commission Věra Jourová, who attended the High-
     Level Digital Dialogue in Beijing on 18 September 2023; Commissioner Virginijus
     Sinkevičius, who took part in the first High-Level Dialogue on Circular Economy in
     Beijing on 22 September 2023; Vice-President of the Commission Valdis Dombrovskis,
     who co-chaired the 10th EU-China High-Level Economic and Trade Dialogue together
     with Chinese Vice-Premier of the State Council, He Lifeng, on 25 September 2023;
     Commissioner Kadri Simson, who participated in the 11th EU-China Energy Dialogue
     in Beijing on 12 October 2023; Vice-President of the Commission / High
     Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, who
     met with the Director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission and
     Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, Wang Yi, during the 12th EU-China Strategic
     Dialogue on 13 October 2023 in Beijing; and Commissioner Thierry Breton, who met
     with Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Guoqing in Beijing on 10 November 2023; whereas
     rebalancing the EU-China economic and trade relationship, and market access and
     supply chain issues were discussed among other issues during these meetings;

R.   whereas the current strategy for relations between the EU and China dates back to 2016,
     and was last updated in 2019, so it would be advisable to carry out a review and update
     of it in light of the new geopolitical context;

1.   Recommends that the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission / High
     Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy:

     Engaging China to tackle global challenges

     (a)   continue engaging pragmatically with China to tackle global challenges such as
           climate change, the protection of biodiversity, challenges to human health and
           pandemic preparedness, food security, the reduction of the risk of disasters, debt
           relief for the Global South, financial stability and humanitarian assistance, and
           increase effective dialogue with China and like-minded partners on security issues
           in view of China’s increasingly critical role in global peace and stability,
           particularly in the light of Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression against
           Ukraine, but also in other conflict regions such as the Korean Peninsula or the
           Middle East;

     (b)   demand that China uphold the rules-based international order, especially the
           universal principles of human rights, the UN Charter, including respect for the
           territorial integrity and the sovereignty of all states, and respect international law,
           organisations and treaties;

     (c)   maintain diplomatic engagement while increasing the EU’s assertiveness towards
           China in order to assume its responsibility as a permanent member of the UN
           Security Council; in this context, further engage China, aiming to stop Chinese
           support to Russia’s military aggression and China’s aiding the circumvention of
           EU sanctions against Russia, and remind China of its own declared commitment
           to play a constructive role in ending Russia’s illegal aggression against Ukraine,
           which encompasses Russia’s immediate, full and unconditional withdrawal of its
           troops from Ukraine;

(d)   reiterate that China, as the world’s largest carbon emitter, must adhere to its own
      promises and act in line with the Paris Agreement by peaking its CO2 emissions
      before 2030 and by participating, proportionally to its economic power, in efforts
      to financially support poorer countries affected by the negative consequences of
      climate change in the context of the Loss and Damage Fund; encourage Member
      States to work with China to bring their mutual policies into line with their
      international commitments and stress that joint efforts with global partners are
      needed to tackle a global problem;

(e)   intensify, together with China, dialogue and close cooperation in the fight against
      illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and, more generally, with regard to the
      sustainable use of marine biological resources and ocean governance;

(f)   insist that China plays a constructive role in multilateral organisations, where
      China is strengthening its role and is actively attempting to reshape norms, such as
      the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
      United Nations;

(g)   respond adequately to China’s increasing efforts to change the multilateral rules-
      based order, through tools such as the BRICS group, the Belt and Road Initiative,
      etc., by ensuring better coordination among the EU Member States, by drafting a
      viable strategy towards the countries of the Global South, and through
      engagement with partners around the world, based on multilateralism and the
      values of the UN Charter, and by increasing the EU’s presence in the Global
      South, namely through its Global Gateway strategy, to create alternative secure
      infrastructure to China’s Belt and Road Initiative;

Opposing China’s human rights violations

(h)   insist that China, as a member of the UN and as a signatory of nine human rights
      treaties under the UN, will be held accountable for its increasing human rights
      violations and efforts to undermine the rules-based order and fulfils its obligations
      and commitments under international law by respecting universal human rights
      and the rule of law, according to international standards; to allow independent
      monitoring of the human rights situation, including by the Office of the United
      Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; to this end, take seriously into
      account the obligations relating to business and human rights under international
      law, in particular the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human
      Rights, as well as European rules on due diligence and the prohibition of goods
      made using forced labour; intensify the Human Rights Dialogue with China with a
      view to bringing genuine improvements and include Members of the European
      Parliament in this dialogue; furthermore, develop a results-oriented EU strategy
      for human rights in China articulating the use of all areas and instruments of EU
      external action; point out that the European External Action Service (EEAS) and
      EU Member States should address China’s increasing human rights relativism and
      the use of its influence in multilateral organisations to alter the paradigm on
      fundamental human rights; express regret of the Chinese membership in the UN
      Human Rights Council;

(i)   ensure a unified European response when China uses its economic leverage to
      silence opposition against its human rights abuses; coordinate its responses with
      international like-minded partners;

(j)   call on the Chinese authorities to take necessary actions to stop grave human
      rights violations, as highlighted in the 2022 report by the Office of the United
      Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as end other measures that
      discriminate or inflict harm against minority groups, such as forced labour and
      political re-education, which include arbitrary and discriminatory detention of
      members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups; urge a proper
      implementation of the recommendations of the independent and impartial UN
      assessment of human rights violations in China, in particular in Xinjiang; call for
      the EU to urge China to allow the UN to carry out an investigation to take place in
      Tibet and Hong Kong; urge the Chinese authorities to grant meaningful access to
      the regions concerned and immediately and unconditionally release the Uyghur
      scholar and 2019 Sakharov Prize Laureate Ilham Tohti and all other activists
      imprisoned and tortured because of regime opposition; more generally, urge the
      termination of systemic repression, the closure of all detention camps and the
      lifting of sanctions and release of all political prisoners and human rights
      defenders detained in China; condemn the use of death penalty; recall that the
      total estimated number of executions in China exceeds all other countries that
      apply capital punishment in 2022; urge China to create full transparency on the
      judicial processes and on the total number of executions; further increase the EU’s
      diplomatic efforts to demand the abolition of the death penalty in China; urge the
      EU and the Member States to offer support to human rights and democracy
      activists in China;

(k)   insist that China respect and guarantee the right to freedom of religion or belief
      and refrain from monitoring, harassing, detaining or otherwise intimidating
      leaders and members of religious groups, both online and offline; condemn
      continuous actions to restrict religious activities in China and, in this context,
      particularly the new legislation on Administrative Measures for Religious Activity
      Venues, which aims to increase party-state oversight of such activities and
      introducing propaganda elements into religious content, as well as the forced
      affiliation of bishops with the CCP-controlled Chinese Patriotic Catholic
      Association;

(l)   call on the Chinese authorities to immediately terminate the practice of family
      separation in Tibet and forced assimilation at residential schools, as highlighted
      by UN experts in February 2023 and condemn Chinese assimilationist policies in
      Tibet that violate the educational, religious, cultural and linguistic rights of the
      Tibetan people and threaten ultimately to eradicate Tibetan culture and identity, in
      particular the compulsory boarding school and pre-school system which separates
      over 1 million Tibetan children from their families and enforces Chinese-language
      education; urge China to immediately abolish the boarding school and pre-school
      system imposed on Tibetan children, to allow private Tibetan schools to be
      established and to ensure that Mandarin is not the only language of instruction in
      Tibet; consider adopting sanctions against the Chinese officials responsible for
      designing and implementing the boarding school and pre-school system in Tibet;
      urge the Chinese authorities to provide information about the nine environmental
      human rights defenders who have been arrested in recent years after they

      protested against illegal mining activities; call on the Chinese authorities to allow
      international and independent observers to access Tibet;

(m) insist that China follow-up on the recommendations of the UN Human Rights
    Committee, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the
    UN Commission on the Status of Women regarding violations of rights and
    freedoms, and breaches of international legal obligations in China, in particular in
    Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong;

(n)   address the systematic use of forced labour by China in Xinjiang and Tibet by
      working with the private sector to diversify supply chains and welcome the
      Commission proposal for a regulation to prohibit products made using forced
      labour, including child labour, on the internal market of the European Union; urge
      the EU co-legislators to speed up the process to come to an agreement as a matter
      of urgency and before the end of the current parliamentary term;

(o)   reiterate its position that the credible evidence about birth prevention measures
      and the separation of Uyghur children from their families amount to crimes
      against humanity; call on the Chinese authorities to put an immediate end to any
      measures aimed at preventing births in the Uyghur population; adopt additional
      sanctions targeting high-ranking PRC officials as well as other individuals and
      entities involved in the systematic human rights violations and crimes against
      humanity in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;

(p)   address individual cases of European citizens, including dual nationals,
      imprisoned in China, such as the Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai, and use all
      diplomatic channels to pressure for their release;

(q)   fully implement the Council conclusions on Hong Kong of 24 July 2020; and
      ensure adequate resources for the European Union Office to Hong Kong (EU
      Office), so that it can continue conducting prison visits, trial observations and
      human rights monitoring, by releasing public statements, appointing a human
      rights focal point among its staff for human rights defenders and raising their
      cases with the authorities at all levels; calls on the EEAS and the EU Office to
      report regularly on the most prominent trials, as well as on the evolution of the
      human rights situation in Hong Kong more generally;

(r)   closely monitor the trials of political prisoners in Hong Kong and call for their
      release, including the former elected legislators who were arrested and imprisoned
      for holding a primary election campaign in 2020;

(s)   show solidarity with civil society across mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao,
      and speed up the implementation of the European human rights framework with
      the EU global human rights sanction regime in close collaboration with
      international partners, including the freezing of foreign assets and visa restrictions
      against those involved in human rights abuses, including political decision makers
      in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong;

(t)   identify and close down any avenues that currently facilitate transnational
      repression, including through digital means, by China in the European Union and,

      in particular, those targeting diaspora communities through so-called police
      stations, in cooperation and coordination with like-minded partners;

(u)   actively work to counteract foreign interference and implement the
      recommendations and suggested initiatives referred to in the different resolutions
      of the European Parliament related to foreign interference in all democratic
      processes in the European Union, including disinformation;

(v)   assess the autonomous status of Hong Kong and Macao in the light of the
      National Security Law, which should be repealed, and the PRC’s violation of its
      international commitments, its breaches of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and
      the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, the International Covenant on Civil and
      Political Rights, the ‘one country, two systems’ principle, the Hong Kong Basic
      Law and the crackdown on the special administrative regions’ autonomy and
      opposition figures, including members of civil society and their family members;
      work towards ensuring media freedom in Hong Kong, which is under threat
      following the imposition of the National Security Law; review the agreement
      between the EU and Hong Kong/China on cooperation and mutual administrative
      assistance in customs matters, the status of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade
      Office in Brussels, and Hong Kong’s seat in the World Trade Organization;

(w) condemn attempts by the Chinese authorities to target Chinese diaspora
    communities within the EU, through the so-called Chinese overseas police service
    stations in the EU, which should unconditionally be closed down, and call on the
    Member States which have not yet done so to suspend all extradition treaties with
    the PRC, Hong Kong and Macau, and to protect individuals who are being
    harassed and persecuted in the EU and those at risk of extradition, and consider
    lifeboat and other visa schemes for the Hong Kong diaspora;

(x)   condemn the practice of the Chinese authorities of returning individuals to a
      country where they risk being tortured, in particular with regard to the forced
      return of people to North Korea, in the light of the UN Security Council
      discussion on human rights violations in North Korea; remind Chinese
      counterparts of their UN legal obligation to refrain from doing so;

(y)   ensure a united European approach on cultural and academic cooperation with
      China, while preventing undue influence from Chinese sources of finance,
      including by investigating the status of research cooperation between EU and
      Chinese institutions and making sure that this cooperation is not used as a foreign
      interference mechanism by the PRC; express grave concern about the accusations
      of the misuse of Confucius Institutes as platforms to spread propaganda, to censor
      all debate about topics deemed ‘politically sensitive’ by the Chinese Government,
      and to spy on students and the Chinese diaspora abroad; evaluate the impact of
      Chinese Government interference in the exercise of academic freedom in
      European educational institutions and campuses;

(z)   encourage more interparliamentary coordination with EU Member States’
      parliaments on China and make full use of parliamentary diplomacy, especially
      with countries in the Global South and strengthen the EU’s parliamentary
      partnership with like-minded partners; ensure the reliable and regular flow of

      information between the various EU institutions on meetings with Chinese
      representatives on both the administrative and the political levels;

De-risking from China to ensure Europe’s open strategic autonomy

(aa) work closely towards fostering unity among the Member States’ approaches
     towards China and strengthen the EU’s strategic autonomy to ensure that Europe
     is able to defend its values and economic interests, as well as the global rules-
     based order;

(ab) work towards a renewed, assertive and coherent EU approach towards China that
     shapes relations with the PRC in the interest of the EU as a whole and takes full
     account of the challenges stemming from the PRC’s rise as a global actor and its
     increasingly oppressive domestic policies, assertive foreign policy, use of
     economic coercion as a means to reach its objectives, including towards Member
     States, such as in the case of Lithuania, and the challenge this poses to
     democracies around the world;

(ac) advance the European Union’s stated goal of de-risking trade flows with the PRC
     to reinforce the EU’s open strategic autonomy without aiming to decouple or
     turning inwards; highlight the importance of reciprocal and balanced trade
     relations, whereby economic diplomacy addresses the structural shortcomings of
     the Chinese market, such as a lack of data protection and forced technology
     transfers, in order to improve fair conditions and market access for European
     companies; address the risks created by China’s acquisition of critical
     infrastructure in the Member States and in the EU neighbourhood; effectively
     implement the tools to prevent sensitive technologies from being leaked and used
     for military purposes, and raise awareness of China’s military-civil fusion
     strategy;

(ad) swiftly implement, in this context, the European Economic Security Strategy to
     foster economic resilience underpinned by a solid risk-assessment tool and make
     better use of our existing trade instruments to minimise the detrimental effects of
     de-risking on the European economy, deter China from engaging in unfair
     practices and to ensure close alignment with like-minded partners around the
     world, such as our transatlantic partners and partners in the Indo-Pacific;

(ae) work towards a more coordinated approach towards the protection of critical
     infrastructure at EU level to limit control by China, countering acts of hybrid
     tactics such as cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, surveillance of the
     Chinese diaspora and espionage originating from China and taking place within
     the European Union, thinking in terms of security beyond economic interests and
     working with partners to ensure a global, open, free, stable and secure cyberspace,
     and continue to counter malicious behaviour by enhancing cybersecurity; increase
     resources for the EU and its Member States to defend against the PRC’s
     cyberespionage activities against EU Member States and demand from China that
     it stop these activities; work with NATO and like-minded partners to reduce the
     risks of espionage and interference in critical infrastructure, in particular
     infrastructure with a military function; call for the EU institutions to terminate any
     research funding to Chinese companies active in the areas of critical and strategic
     importance for the EU;

(af) ensure greater coordination and cooperation with like-minded partners on issues
     of common concern to address the multi-dimensional challenge posed by China,
     especially but not exclusively on issues such as strategic dependencies, economic
     coercion, political interference and disinformation, and to promote rules-based
     multilateralism and strategic solidarity between democracies;

(ag) further highlight the positive effect and strategic importance of deepening ties
     between the EU and Taiwan, which is a reliable and valued partner playing an
     indispensable role as a technology and trade partner; coordinate, in this regard,
     with the EU’s global partners;

(ah) uphold the EU’s engagement policy with Taiwan in order to intensify cooperation
     and continue supporting democracy there; encourage further exchanges between
     the European Parliament and its Taiwanese interlocutors in this context, as well as
     cooperation between the EU, Member States and Taiwan on issues of common
     interest; support steps towards allowing Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the
     meetings, mechanism and activities of relevant international institutions such as
     the WHO, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the UN Framework
     Convention on Climate Change;

(ai) ensure clear and consistent signalling by the EU and its Member States that its
     position on the EU’s ‘One China policy’ has not changed and that any attempt to
     unilaterally change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, particularly by means of
     force or coercion, cannot be accepted and will have high costs; support initiatives
     aimed at promoting dialogue, cooperation and confidence-building between the
     two sides; prepare a scenario-based strategy for tackling potential security
     challenges in the Taiwan Strait and work together with regional partners to
     prevent any unilateral change to the status quo by taking concrete steps to
     discourage China from escalating tensions in the region, including through
     increasing Coordinated Maritime Presences in the Taiwan Strait, facilitating
     Taiwan’s security resilience and considering economic sanction packages in the
     event of Chinese aggression;

(aj) condemn China’s increasing military provocation around the Taiwan Strait and
     oppose China’s constant distortion of UN Resolution 2758 (XXVI) by demanding
     that Taiwanese passport holders, including journalists, NGO workers and political
     activists be barred from accessing tours and events in the UN;

(ak) increase the EU’s economic and diplomatic presence throughout the Indo-Pacific
     region and recall that the world’s strategic and economic centre of gravity is
     shifting to this region, and that the EU therefore has a clear interest in forging a
     credible EU-level approach to the Indo-Pacific; underline the importance of
     freedom of navigation to be respected by China, including in the South and East
     China Seas; work with China and the EU’s regional partners to ensure freedom of
     navigation and open and unrestricted shipping lanes, and encourage Member
     States to explore forms of cooperation, including military cooperation, with
     regional and global partners to ensure freedom of navigation in the South China
     and East China Seas and deter any attempts at limiting freedom of navigation;
     stress that the EEAS, together with EU Member States, should reject China’s
     unlawful and unreasonable claims in the South China and East China Seas and
     any unilateral attempts at controlling contested areas and territories;

     (al) address China’s increased presence in the Arctic and its policy and goals in the
          region, including its ambitions to launch a Polar Silk Road, to expand its energy
          supply and to access Arctic resources; examine the impact thereof on security,
          regional governance and the environment;

     (am) strengthen the work of the EEAS Strategic Communication division on tackling
          foreign information manipulation and interference by state actors such as China;
          point out that these efforts must be allocated sufficient resources, given the scale
          of the problem and its detrimental effects on the EU and its Member States’
          political systems; work with the Commission to encourage and coordinate actions
          aimed at countering China’s foreign financing of our democratic processes and
          China’s malign influence, including the strategy of elite capture and the technique
          of co-opting top-level civil servants and former EU politicians; strengthen
          expertise and language capacity with regard to China in the EEAS, in Member
          States and in the EU institutions in general to make use of open-source
          intelligence;

     (an) fully leverage the Global Gateway strategy as a tool to intensify the EU’s
          engagement in global development efforts and business relations with partners
          from developing countries to provide an alternative to Chinese-driven foreign
          investment strategies; intensify cooperation with international financial
          institutions and the private sector to mobilise the necessary funding;

     (ao) strengthen cooperation between national intelligence agencies in identifying and
          addressing Chinese espionage and other subversive activities seeking to influence
          or undermine our democracies, and fully implement all EU guidelines and
          measures to mitigate security risks across Europe’s connectivity infrastructure;

     (ap) increase cooperation with like-minded partners on international standard setting in
          the relevant international bodies to ensure Europe’s economic competitiveness
          and to prevent one-sided Chinese dominance;

     (aq) fully implement the EU’s ‘5G security toolbox’ guidelines to mitigate security
          risks in networks, and propose additional security standards for Chinese suppliers
          of 5G; welcomes the decision of the EU institutions and institutions in several EU
          Member States to suspend the TikTok application on corporate devices, as well as
          personal devices enrolled in the institutions’ mobile device services;

2.   Instructs its President to forward this recommendation to the Council, the Commission
     and the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for
     Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and, for information, to the Government of the
     People’s Republic of China.

–    having regard to the opinion of the Committee on International Trade,

–    having regard to the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (A9-0401/2023),

A.   whereas the recent joint communication on a European economic security strategy
     focuses on minimising and managing the risks arising from certain economic flows and
     the EU’s dependency on authoritarian and totalitarian regimes such as the People’s
     Republic of China (PRC) in the context of increased geopolitical tensions and
     accelerating technological shifts, while protecting free market principles from distortion
     by such regimes and, thereby, preserving maximum economic openness and dynamism;

B.   whereas disruptions to critical infrastructure can have significant negative consequences
     for vital government functions, essential services for the population, economic activity
     as well as the security and defence of the EU; whereas it is crucial that Member States
     and the Commission be vigilant with regard to financial investments that foreign
     countries make in the operation of critical entities within the EU and the consequences
     that such investments could have on the ability to prevent significant disruptions;

C.   whereas the Resilience of Critical Entities Directive2 and the NIS 2 Directive3 provide a
     comprehensive legal framework to strengthen both the physical and digital resilience of
     critical infrastructure, including that related to energy, transport, health, digital
     infrastructure, water and food;

D.   whereas since the Council Recommendation of 8 December 2022 was issued, targeted
     actions have already been carried out to ensure a common EU response to incidents,

1    OJ C 20, 20.1.2023, p. 1.
2    Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of 14 December 2022 on the resilience of critical entities and
     repealing Council Directive 2008/114/EC (OJ L 333, 27.12.2022, p. 164).
3    Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of 14 December 2022 on measures for a high common level
     of cybersecurity across the Union, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and
     Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive)
     (OJ L 333, 27.12.2022, p. 80).

     including by strengthening coordination with NATO through the EU-NATO Task Force
     on the resilience of critical infrastructure embedded in the NATO-EU Structured
     Dialogue on Resilience;

E.   whereas European ports in which Chinese state-owned companies have stakes handle
     more than 10 % of Europe’s total shipping container capacity; whereas the three largest
     Chinese shareholders in European ports have assets in almost half the ports (14 out of
     29) that are located either close to naval bases or provide logistical support to NATO
     forces, greatly increasing the risk of espionage;

F.   whereas the coercive policies and the growing assertiveness of the People’s Republic of
     China (PRC), including its increasingly aggressive stance towards Taiwan and the
     aggressive posture assumed in the South China Sea, as well as the social and economic
     consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian war of aggression against
     Ukraine have exposed the EU’s vulnerabilities and reaffirmed the need to ‘de-risk’ its
     relations vis-à-vis the PRC and other undemocratic third countries;

G.   whereas the Chinese government has demonstrated that it is willing to weaponise its
     overwhelming control of global rare earth supplies for political ends and to obtain unfair
     economic concessions and advantages;

H.   whereas China is restricting non-Chinese companies from participating in infrastructure
     projects on account of the security risks and is putting forward legislation with regard to
     critical infrastructure, such as the Critical Information Infrastructure Security Protection
     Regulations; whereas China is involved in constructing EU-funded infrastructure in
     various EU Member States; whereas pursuant to international commitments, it is
     possible for the EU and the Member States to adopt restrictive measures relating to
     foreign direct investment (FDI) on the grounds of security or public order, subject to
     certain requirements; whereas in 2021-22, China engaged in an economic blockade
     against Lithuania in response to Lithuania’s decision to withdraw from the Belt and
     Road Initiative and to open a Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania, resulting in
     the Commission’s request to establish a panel at the World Trade Organisation to
     examine the legality of China’s trade restrictions against Lithuanian and EU exports
     containing Lithuanian content, and whereas this demonstrates China’s assertiveness in
     targeting specific EU countries, not only through direct economic coercion, but also
     through the threat of secondary sanctions;

I.   whereas the spread of China’s digital authoritarianism and mass surveillance continues
     to intensify both within China and beyond, targeting democratic institutions and
     societies, and it risks establishing a new international order that would endanger
     freedom and democracy around the world; whereas a large number of Chinese students
     study in Member States’ universities, especially in the field of dual-use technologies,
     potentially leading in some cases to a high risk of espionage; whereas former European
     fighter pilots have been employed by the Chinese army and such recruitment creates a
     serious risk of transfer of critical information putting the military-strategic interests of
     the countries concerned at risk; whereas Chinese ambitions are growing in strategic
     areas such as AI, cloud computing, semiconductors, or hardware; whereas these
     instruments, particularly AI, could be developed for military purposes, driving the next
     revolution in military affairs;

J.   whereas China’s acquisition of critical infrastructure, especially within the EU and in its
     neighbourhood, including the Western Balkans and Africa poses an increasing multi-
     dimensional risk to the EU’s security;

K.   whereas China’s national security related legislation, such as the 2015 National Security
     Law of the People’s Republic of China, requires citizens and organisations to provide
     support and assistance to the PRC’s public security, state security or military bodies;

L.   whereas the Sino-Russian strategic partnership formalised with the Joint Statement ‘on
     the international relations entering a new era and the global sustainable development’ of
     4 February 2022 continues to grow, including in the areas of technology and military
     know-how and capability transfers, posing an increasing threat to European security;

The core of the problem: understanding China’s military-civil fusion strategy

1.   Underlines that China’s military-civil fusion (MCF) strategy is a state-led, state-directed
     programme and plans to instrumentalise all levers of state and commercial power to
     strengthen and support the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its armed wing, the
     People’s Liberation Army (PLA), particularly by acquiring and diverting the world’s
     cutting-edge technologies, with the objective of strengthening the totalitarian regime
     and achieving military dominance;

2.   Considers that China’s party-driven political system and economy often require private
     companies to align their commercial interests with the CCP, including its military
     activities, repression, influence and political interference activities; notes that CCP party
     cells inside private companies are commonly used as tools of direct party control;
     highlights that, consequentially, Chinese companies’ international activities support the
     CCP’s goals of expanding its influence in third countries, undermining geopolitical
     rivals and increasing China’s influence;

3.   Believes that MCF must be understood in a larger geopolitical, economic and strategic
     context, taking into account its interconnections with other initiatives, such as the Belt
     and Road Initiative, the Digital Silk Road (including Made in China 2025, China
     Standards 2035), the Global Security Initiative, Dual Circulation strategy) and China’s
     increasing assertiveness and aggressive posturing abroad; believes that the ultimate aim
     of MCF is to advance the party-state’s long-term strategic goal to become the world’s
     leading power in terms of political influence, economic capacities, technological
     dominance and military might, and to undermine the rules-based international order;

4.   Recalls that achieving primacy in science and technology has been one of the CCP’s top
     priorities in recent years and that the CCP’s MCF strategy incentivises the sharing of
     research and development results between market-oriented and Chinese defence
     industries; stresses the repeated warnings by intelligence agencies against the risks of
     economic dependence, espionage and sabotage caused by the economic presence of
     entities from certain non-EU countries, in particular China, in critical infrastructure and
     strategic sectors across the EU; is, in this regard, concerned by the political pressure
     asserted in the approval of specific Chinese investments into critical infrastructure, as in
     the case of the German government’s decision to agree to the acquisition of a stake at
     the port of Hamburg by COSCO, contrary to the advice of the competent institutions;

Consequences of the PRC’s military-civil fusion strategy

5.   Warns of the risk of Chinese companies having any involvement with EU strategic
     assets, especially those companies that have direct or indirect links to China’s political-
     military or intelligence systems; underlines, in this regard, its concern that technology
     and technological expertise used in civilian activities, particularly in the economic
     sphere, continues to be transferred to China’s military, increasing the PLA’s ability to
     develop the next generation of military technology, which may be used to coerce
     partners in Asia and around the world; urges EU Member States to increase regulatory
     oversight and introduce specific background checks over individuals and legal entities
     with direct ties to the Chinese government;

6.   Is concerned that that 98 % of EU demand for rare earths is being met by the PRC;
     emphasises that China produces 70 % of the world’s batteries (hosting three of the top
     five battery manufacturing giants), accounts for 60 % of global aluminium production
     and 75 % of silicon production, as well as 94 % the global production of gallium
     and around 60 % of germanium production, and is the leading refiner of 60 % of lithium
     and 70 % of copper processing and produces 84 % of the world’s nickel and 85 % of its
     cobalt; underlines that Chinese mining companies are active in Serbia (copper and
     gold), the Democratic Republic of Congo (cobalt), Indonesia (nickel) and Chile and
     Australia (lithium) and that its quasi-monopoly in the production and processing of
     these critical commodities creates crucial dependencies and therefore presents not only
     an acute geopolitical challenge for the EU, but also a huge risk for Europe’s defence
     and other key industrial sectors as well as its open strategic autonomy and European
     economic security strategy;

7.   Welcomes, in this regard the Commission proposal for the Critical Raw Materials Act
     and calls for the speedy implementation of its goals in order to strengthen the EU’s
     supply chain resilience; recalls that critical raw materials are essential to the security
     and defence sector as well as for the success of the EU’s digital and green transitions;
     calls on the Commission and the Member States, in coordination with industry
     stakeholders to implement the decision to gradually reduce the dependence on China by
     diversifying the sources of critical raw minerals and rare earth elements, establishing
     strategic partnerships with reliable third countries with a view to ensuring a secure and
     reliable supply of critical raw materials; urges the EU to assist Member States in
     developing projects that will aim for greater independence from Chinese production;

8.   Strongly advocates for the diversification of suppliers and partners in critical
     infrastructure initiatives to reduce the vulnerability to external influences, ensuring that
     reliance on any single source is minimised;

9.   Is concerned that privately owned undersea cables provided by Chinese companies,
     such as HMN Technologies, a PLA cyber intelligence–affiliated entity, are used to
     support EU and Member States’ diplomatic and military communications; expresses its
     grave concern over the undersea data cable systems operated by Chinese company
     HMN Technologies, which connect EU Member States’ territories and the Indo-Pacific
     region, including Member State and NATO military bases, creating security
     vulnerabilities as regards cybersecurity, underwater surveillance, data collection, and
     gathering of intelligence; in this regard, is further concerned by the sale of a Dutch
     company, the backbone of Estonia’s internet infrastructure, to a Chinese company
     linked to the PLA; highlights the need for a joint effort among the Member States to
     prevent similar cases;

10.   Recalls the need to perform a thorough evaluation of the EU institutions’ information
      security infrastructure and services, in particular regarding classified communications
      between the institutions and missions and operations abroad; recalls that the full supply
      chain should be taken into account to ensure that the companies do not have any direct
      or indirect links with the PRC; calls for specific provisions in EU institutions
      procurements procedures to limit the risk of interference, including the acquisition,
      maintenance or vetting by a third party;

11.   Warns that major investments in seaports, railways and airports give Beijing the
      opportunity to monitor and control activities in key logistical nodes with a fundamental
      strategic dimension;

12.   Highlights the fact that, in 2022, China was the EU’s second largest trading partner for
      goods; expresses concern about the increasingly imbalanced trade and investment
      relationship between the EU and China, which is also highlighted by the EU’s record
      trade deficit of EUR 396 billion in 2022 and its dependence on Chinese imports and
      investments in some critical sectors; highlights China’s imbalanced international trade
      policy in the context of its dual circulation strategy; asks the Commission to raise the
      EU’s concerns with China on its managed trade practices;

Developing responses: expanding the toolkit to respond to security and defence concerns

13.   Argues that a key area of EU critical infrastructure is its network of research institutes
      and research and development facilities, which play an important role in the EU’s
      ability to deliver on its green and digital transition commitments, alongside key arenas
      such as space defence; recalls the security vulnerabilities linked to forced technology
      transfers, intellectual property theft and knowledge leaks, both in the EU and abroad;
      calls for increased vigilance when accounting for such threats to the EU’s ability to
      innovate and foster growth;

14.   Notes that Chinese companies are already leaders in key technologies used in sectors
      such as 5G wireless infrastructure, drones, batteries, hypersonic missiles, solar and wind
      energy, as well as cryptocurrency; expresses its concerns over the uses of these
      technologies and the dependencies they create; notes, in this regard, that 100 % of the
      5G RAN in Cyprus is composed of Chinese equipment, and 59 % in the case of
      Germany; stresses that this runs counter to the EU’s ‘5G security toolbox’ guidelines to
      mitigate security risks in networks and calls on the Council and the Commission to
      exclude the use of equipment and software from manufacturers based in the PRC in
      core network functions; recalls that Huawei has been participating in 11 projects under
      Horizon Europe until June 2023, thus receiving EUR 3,89 million of funding in total;
      therefore, urges the EU and European institutions to carry out a systematic screening of
      Chinese companies benefiting directly or indirectly from European programmes of
      strategic importance for the EU and, where necessary, terminate their participation;
      furthermore, calls on the Commission to propose additional security standards for
      Chinese suppliers of 5G and the next generation 6G network;

15.   Considers the TikTok app, owned by Chinese conglomerate ByteDance, to be in breach
      of the European data privacy framework, making it a potential risk and a source of
      Chinese-backed disinformation; welcomes the decision of EU institutions and those of
      several EU Member States to suspend the use of the TikTok application on corporate
      devices, as well as personal devices enrolled in the institutions’ mobile device services;

16.   Warns that the deterioration in the security environment in Europe, in its
      neighbourhood, and around the globe requires urgent reflection on how to strengthen
      the EU’s open strategic autonomy and reduce its dependence on countries such as the
      PRC and systemic rivals that pose a security threat to the EU; stresses the need to
      prevent sensitive emerging technologies and key dual-use items, especially those that
      are critical to the EU’s security and defence from being transferred to destinations of
      concern that pursue or collaborate in MCF strategies; regards the establishment of EU-
      wide electronic customs and export licensing systems to be a critical step towards
      effective common European export controls and urges all Member States to make these
      systems operational by the end of 2024; furthermore calls on the EU institutions and the
      Member States to strengthen cooperation with the transatlantic and other like-minded
      partners in the protection of critical infrastructure, and to defend democracy and
      preserve our shared values, security and prosperity;

17.   Remains concerned that European critical infrastructure, from telecommunications
      networks to port facilities, is becoming increasingly vulnerable to external influence;
      commends, in this regard, recent legislative steps to enhance the resilience of critical
      entities in the EU; notes with concern, however, that such initiatives are largely limited
      to FDI screening procedures, leaving other channels open for the CCP to gain access to
      and influence over critical assets, including through elite capture, technology and
      intellectual property transfers, as well as supply chain and sales market dependencies;
      notes that the establishment of a thorough risk assessment and mapping framework is
      imperative to identifying critical infrastructure assets and their susceptibilities;
      considers it necessary to map, track and assess China’s and other third countries’ access
      to critical infrastructure in the EU and to jointly proceed with mitigating measures
      where necessary; in this regard, calls on the Commission, with the support of the
      Member States, to compile an exhaustive inventory of critical assets and systematically
      evaluate their vulnerability to external influences; and therefore calls for the expansion
      of the legislative initiatives to address such risks;

18.   Calls on the Commission to share with Parliament, before the end of this parliamentary
      term, a detailed analysis of the trade risks linked to technologies such as
      semiconductors, quantum computing, block chains, space, artificial intelligence and
      biotechnologies and the possible need for EU action in these fields;

19.   Recalls that the FDI screening regulation1 addresses risks to security and public order
      resulting from investments from outside the EU; notes the key added value of the
      screening mechanism as a pertinent tool that gives the EU and the Member States a
      better strategic overview and situational awareness of the trends, targets, means and
      methods deployed by foreign actors to increase their economic and political influence;
      calls for the current instruments that address FDI and foreign subsidies to be expanded
      to include generalised screening procedures for all stakeholders involved in EU critical
      infrastructure projects encompassing all modes of participation in critical infrastructure
      endeavours, including collaborative ventures, partnerships and technology transfers;
      also underlines that routine evaluations of critical infrastructure projects that involve
      non-EU stakeholders are essential and believes that this process should encompass
      scrutiny of ownership structures, dependencies within supply chains, and the transfer of
      technology associated with these projects; also, considers it necessary to establish due-

1     Regulation (EU) 2019/452 of 19 March 2019 establishing a framework for the
      screening of foreign direct investments into the Union (OJ L 79 I, 21.3.2019, p. 1).

      diligence standards to identify China’s leverage over investors in EU critical
      infrastructure, and underlines that this approach should apply equally to candidate and
      potential candidate countries; stresses that the Member States are ultimately responsible
      for infrastructure protection, but have not consistently implemented current guidelines
      on FDI; is greatly concerned, in this regard, by the fact that not all Member States have
      in place or use mechanisms for screening foreign investment in critical infrastructure;
      urgently calls on the Member States to consistently implement current legislation
      related to FDI and on the resilience of critical entities;

20.   Regrets in this regard the lack of adequate screening of risks of interference in public
      procurement related to security equipment, such as the case of the contract signed by
      Strasbourg airport to install airport security scanners and gates supplied by the
      European subsidiary of the Chinese company Nuctech, partly owned by the Chinese
      government and bound by the ‘United Front’ policy; warns that any such technologies
      could incorporate in-built security gaps or be accessed during their maintenance; on the
      other hand, welcomes the decision of the Romanian government to terminate
      negotiations with China General Nuclear Power Corporation, CGNPC, on the
      construction of nuclear reactors 3 and 4 at Cernavoda;

21.   Stresses, however, that a strategic balance must be found between, on the one hand, the
      openness of the EU single market and its attractiveness for investments, and, on the
      other, the defence of the EU’s critical infrastructure and autonomy, considering the
      EU’s security vulnerabilities, especially as regards economic coercion or threats to the
      integrity of the EU’s critical infrastructure;

22.   Calls on the Commission to consider ways of making its opinions on FDI screening
      more impactful, in order to avoid distortions of the single market and a race to the
      bottom among Member States; calls on the Commission and the Member States to
      increase harmonisation, including by building appropriate expertise, and to fully
      implement the FDI screening regulation; believes that there is scope and the need for
      the regulation to be strengthened in its upcoming review at the end of the year;
      encourages the Commission to present an ambitious legislative proposal on a revised
      regulation addressing all the loopholes that have emerged during its implementation,
      and to swiftly evaluate the possibility of a legislative proposal on a screening
      mechanism for outbound investments; recommends building any proposed outbound
      investment screening mechanism on an impact assessment that includes appropriate
      consultation with businesses to minimise any potential negative consequences for
      European competitiveness;

23.   Welcomes the new ‘de-risking’ approach in the proposed European economic security
      strategy of 20 June 2023, which aims to maximise the benefits of the EU’s economic
      openness and to protect, promote and strengthen the EU’s open strategic autonomy,
      while minimising the risks resulting from economic dependencies and their possible
      weaponisation, including investments and research collaboration in key enabling
      technologies with military applications, inter alia, in the areas of quantum computing,
      advanced semiconductors and artificial intelligence; calls for the swift adoption of the
      High Representative’s and the Commission’s proposals and calls on Member States to
      fully implement the EU’s expanded regulatory framework to exclude entities that could
      contribute to MCF and to find alternatives for Chinese-financed projects in the EU
      through the development of a comprehensive approach to commonly identifying,
      assessing and managing risks to European economic security;

24.   Further welcomes the High Representative and Commission’s proposal to prevent the
      leakage of sensitive emerging technologies by establishing a list of dual-use
      technologies, based on narrowly defined and forward-looking criteria, such as the
      potential enabling and transformative nature of a technology, the risk of MCF and the
      risk of the technology being misused to violate human rights; calls on the Commission
      and the Member States to identify and implement the relevant protection measures for
      these dual-use technologies as soon as possible;

25.   Calls, in this regard, on the Commission, in coordination with the Member States, to
      design a rapid response mechanism for the detection of the dual use, or misuse, of
      infrastructures in the EU under Chinese ownership, participation or concession, that
      could be used to terminate the rights of concession and/or suspend the capacity of
      domain in the cases of ownership and participation; calls on the Commission to
      annually report to Parliament on:

      (a)   the detection of the possible dual use of strategic infrastructure that provides
            logistical and intelligence support to China;

      (b)   the full respect of EU trade legislation, especially concerning due diligence, anti-
            coercion and goods made with forced labour entering the EU market;

26.   Welcomes the adoption of the European Chips Act, which will increase the EU’s ability
      to produce semiconductors and create a strategic map of, inter alia, capability gaps in
      the semiconductor value chain in the EU, thereby limiting the EU’s dependence on third
      countries such as China; calls for further proposals to secure the production and supply
      chains of critical infrastructure and materials within the EU; further calls on the
      Commission and Member States to develop additional initiatives aimed at enabling
      closer coordination and collaboration with like-minded partners and allies, and to
      monitor and further develop, where possible and in line with the EU’s aim to reduce
      further dependencies, global production capacities and supply chains in critical
      infrastructure and materials that are crucial to the security and defence of the EU; draws
      particular attention to Taiwan, which plays a significant role in the global supply chains
      and in the international rules-based order; reiterates its long-standing support for the
      EU-Taiwan Bilateral Investment Agreement and any arrangements mutually beneficial
      to bilateral trade and investment;

27.   Calls on the Commission to propose a new legislative framework to mitigate the
      security risks coming from the suppliers of undersea cable systems, including through
      stricter monitoring and frequent review of the ownership structures of such suppliers,
      their previous investments in undersea cable systems and the proximity of the undersea
      cable systems to European and allied military bases; stresses the need to prevent cable
      system suppliers, such as Chinese companies, from sharing data with intelligence
      services other than to protect the infrastructure from outside intrusions or malign
      attacks; calls in this regard for initiatives aimed at the further development of European
      owned or based companies in the field of undersea cable systems;

28.   Underlines that EU responses must be built around an augmented understanding of the
      relevant strategic picture centred on cross-policy and cross-national threat assessments
      and vulnerability studies on critical infrastructure; is of the opinion that a decentralised
      or neglectful approach, lacking clear visibility and scrutiny over projects with strategic
      significance for Europe’s defence and security, could greatly harm the EU’s geopolitical

      interests1; recalls vulnerabilities linked to foreign interference, specifically in the
      information space, and the interplay between FDI projects and information
      manipulation operations by malign foreign actors;

Internal-external nexus: strengthening the resilience of the EU’s closest partners

29.   Expresses concern regarding the PRC’s penetration of the EU market and its wider
      neighbourhood; calls on the Commission and the European External Action Service
      (EEAS) to ensure that the measures taken to strengthen the resilience of the EU in the
      face of Chinese influence, including de-risking, diversification and reduction of critical
      dependencies, are also extended to the EU’s closest partners, in particular accession
      countries and those part of the EUs neighbourhood policy;

30.   Recalls that the PRC’s naval forces have means and legal tools to ensure that China’s
      civilian ships and infrastructure can be used for military and security purposes;
      considers that China is able to use its civilian commercial infrastructure to support the
      PLA’s presence in third countries; warns that such MCF provides the PLA with access
      to foreign ports, enabling it to pre-position logistics support to sustain naval
      deployments as far afield as the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic
      Ocean; underlines that the risks of espionage are highest when Chinese civilian
      commercial assets are located in logistical hubs close to EU and NATO naval bases or
      port operators that have signed agreements to provide logistical support to European
      companies; calls on the Member States to urgently address the need to reduce the risks
      of espionage and sabotage in critical infrastructure, in particular those with a military
      function, such as ports that are used by NATO; stresses, in this regard, that the EU and
      NATO must work together to develop a long-term plan to counter China’s MCF
      strategy in Europe and calls on the full implementation of the final assessment report of
      the EU-NATO task force2;

31.   Notes that ports are gateways to the world and as such play a crucial role in the EU’s
      economy; notes with concern that Chinese-owned or controlled entities have
      strategically increased their stakes in European ports and port infrastructure; calls on the
      Commission to present an EU strategic policy framework to reduce and limit influence
      and operational control by China and other regimes; recalls also that PRC projects
      power overseas by using a network of commercial ports and dual-use facilities that
      provide logistics and intelligence support to the Chinese navy; notes that in 2022,
      Chinese companies owned or operated terminals in 96 ports across 53 countries; further
      notes that in at least nine ports, two of which are in Europe, People’s Liberation Army
      Navy (PLAN) warships have undergone significant repairs or maintenance for vessels
      and equipment; points out that naval visits reveal areas of influence, prioritised
      operational zones, intelligence collection objectives and cooperation priorities;

32.   Emphasises the need for a geopolitical approach to global cooperation on critical
      infrastructure in order for the EU to successfully face up to the new security challenges;
      notes that one third of all African infrastructure built since 2010, including around 50 %

      Policies of the Union, ‘Security implications of China-owned critical infrastructure in
      the European Union’, June 2023.

      infrastructure: Final assessment report, June 2023.

      of Africa’s 3G networks and 70 % of its 4G networks, has been financed and
      constructed by Chinese state-owned enterprises; underlines that, over the past 20 years,
      China has increased its trade, investment and loan commitments by USD 160 billion
      with African Governments and their state-owned enterprises with few, or opaque,
      contractual obligations, predominantly in transportation, power generation, mining and
      telecommunications; highlights in particular the fact that a single Chinese
      telecommunication company has constructed up to 70 % of Africa’s information
      technology infrastructure, as well as the role played by Chinese companies in the
      financing, building, expansion and renovation of at least 14 sensitive intra-
      governmental African telecommunication networks; expresses concern that the Chinese
      model is clearly attractive to many countries that cannot or are unwilling to satisfy EU
      requirements for access to equivalent levels of finance, thereby expanding Chinese
      influence to the detriment of EU partnerships and triggering risks of unsustainable debt
      for these countries, harming their long-term development to the detriment of their local
      population; calls on the Commission, the EEAS and Member States to intensify efforts,
      including attracting investments from the private sector, to implement the Global
      Gateway Investment Package of EUR 150 billion, agreed at the 6th EU-AU Summit in
      February 2022; urges the Council and the Commission to swiftly implement projects,
      especially lighthouse projects, under the initiative;

33.   Underlines its concern that the PRC’s strategy to build a ‘blue economy cooperation
      base’ along the coast of Africa, including through the construction of fishing vessels
      and vessel repairs facilities, could also be used for military purposes; stresses that there
      is a general lack of detail and transparency regarding these agreements and licences
      with African countries; outlines the potential geopolitical consequences for the EU,
      especially in third countries where the EU is engaged;

–    having regard to Article 36 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, which
     guarantees all citizens the right to freedom of religious belief, and to Article 4 thereof,
     which upholds the rights of ‘minority nationalities’,

–    having regard to Rule 54 of its Rules of Procedure,

–    having regard to the opinion of the Committee on International Trade,

–    having regard to the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (A9-0252/2021),

A.   whereas in its strategic framework on human rights and democracy, the EU pledges that
     human rights, democracy and the rule of law will be promoted ‘in all areas of the EU’s
     external actions without exception’, and that it will ‘place human rights at the centre of
     its relations with all third countries, including its strategic partners’;

B.   whereas through its strong economic growth and assertive foreign policy agenda,
     notably its investment strategy, its ‘Going Global’ and ‘Made in China 2025’ policies,
     and its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China is asserting a stronger global role both as
     an economic power and as foreign policy actor, which poses serious political, economic,
     security and technological challenges to the EU, which in turn has significant and long-
     lasting consequences for the world order, and poses serious threats to rules-based
     multilateralism and core democratic values;

C.   whereas the People’s Republic of China is a unitary, one-party communist state,
     governed by the Communist Party of China (CPC), which is committed to Marxism–
     Leninism; whereas as such it does not share democratic values such as individual
     freedom, freedom of speech and freedom of religion;

D.   whereas China is increasingly aspiring to a more global role, as Chinese President Xi
     Jinping openly vowed in his report delivered at the 19th Communist Party Congress in
     2017 that by 2049 China would become a global leader in terms of composite national
     strength and international influence;

E.   whereas the long-term tradition of democracy in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan
     demonstrates that democracy is valued by the Chinese people;

F.   whereas in Macau, after prohibiting ceremonies to mark the anniversary of the
     Tiananmen massacre and pressuring media organisations to adopt a pro-China editorial
     line, this summer, the Chinese authorities excluded 21 candidates, most of whom are
     members of pro-democracy movements, from participating in the next legislative
     elections;

G.   whereas China has a track record of human rights violations that eschew the country’s
     bilateral and multilateral commitments in these areas; whereas China has regularly
     submitted resolutions to the UN Human Rights Council aimed at making ‘sovereignty,
     non-interference and mutual respect’ fundamental, non-negotiable principles that
     override the promotion and protection of the human rights of individuals; whereas
     China has been pursuing the systemic persecution of the Uyghur people, Tibetans,
     Mongols and other ethnic minorities, human rights defenders, social activists, religious
     groups, journalists, and petitioners and protesters against injustices, as well as
     increasingly repressing all dissenting and opposition voices, especially in Hong Kong;

     whereas goodwill measures and non-binding commitments have not been sufficient to
     increase China’s commitment to values that are fundamental for the EU;

H.   whereas the recent departure of foreign correspondents from China and the labelling by
     the Chinese authorities of the Foreign Correspondents’ Club as an ‘illegal organisation’
     are the latest in a long and increasing series of cases of harassment and obstruction
     against foreign journalists, who are ultimately being driven out of China; whereas this
     comes as part of an effort to police speech about China worldwide and to determine
     what kind of speech and discussions are allowed globally, and sees this effort as part of
     a totalitarian threat;

I.   whereas the existing EU-China strategy has revealed its limitations in the light of recent
     developments and the global challenges posed by China and needs to be updated;

J.   whereas Parliament has called on the Commission to start the scoping exercise and
     impact assessment in order to formally commence the negotiations with Taiwan as soon
     as possible;

K.   whereas since the launch of the Chinese Government’s ‘Strike hard against violent
     terrorism’ campaign in 2014, the situation of Uyghur and other primarily Muslim ethnic
     minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has rapidly deteriorated;
     whereas more than one million people are imprisoned in detention camps, called
     ‘political re-education’ or ‘training’ centres, in which Uyghurs are subject to systemic
     forced labour, torture, enforced disappearance, mass surveillance, cultural and religious
     erasure, the forced sterilisation of women, sexual violence, violations of reproductive
     rights and family separation; whereas legal analysis has concluded that these offences
     constitute crimes against humanity, even alleged genocide, within the international legal
     framework; whereas several national parliaments have adopted positions along these
     lines;

L.   whereas the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime enables the EU to impose
     restrictive measures on targeted individuals, entities and bodies, including states and
     non-state actors, responsible for, involved in or associated with serious human rights
     violations and abuses; whereas on 22 March 2021 four Chinese individuals and one
     entity directly responsible for serious human rights violations in the Xinjiang Uyghur
     Autonomous Region were included on the list of natural persons and entities subject to
     these restrictive measures; whereas in response to these measures, China imposed
     counter-sanctions on ten European individuals and four entities, including five Members
     of the European Parliament and two EU institutional bodies, the Subcommittee on
     Human Rights of the European Parliament and the Political and Security Committee of
     the Council of the European Union, as well as two European scholars, two think tanks
     in Germany and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation in Denmark; whereas Chinese
     sanctions lacked legal justification and a legal basis and directly targeted not only the
     individuals and entities concerned but also the European Union as a whole; whereas the
     sanctions are clearly an attempt to deter the EU from continuing its work and action
     against human rights abuses in China;

1.   Recommends that the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the
     Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR) and the Council:

     (a)   develop a more assertive, comprehensive and consistent EU-China strategy that
           unites all Member States and shapes relations with China in the interest of the EU
           as a whole, with the defence of our values at its core and promoting a rules-based
           multilateral order; underlines that the strategy needs to take into account the
           multifaceted nature of the EU’s relationship with China; highlights that China is a
           cooperation and negotiating partner for the EU, but is also an economic
           competitor and a systemic rival in an increasing number of areas;

     (b)   propose that this strategy be based on six pillars:

           (1)   Open dialogue and cooperation on global challenges;

           (2)   Enhanced engagement on universal values, international norms and human
                 rights;

           (3)   Analysis and identification of the risks, vulnerabilities and challenges;

           (4)   Building partnerships with like-minded partners;

           (5)   Fostering open strategic autonomy, including in trade and investment
                 relations;

           (6)   Defence and promotion of core European interests and values by
                 transforming the EU into a more effective geopolitical actor;

Open dialogue and cooperation on global challenges

2.   Calls on the VP/HR to ensure that the new EU-China strategy involves China in a
     principled and interest-oriented dialogue on global challenges, such as human rights, by
     developing an ambitious, holistic and results-oriented EU strategy for human rights in
     China as part of this new EU-China strategy, the environment and climate change,
     nuclear disarmament, the promotion of the economic recovery from COVID-19, the
     fight against global health crises, and the reform of specific multilateral organisations;
     calls for this dialogue to be driven by EU fundamental principles and interests and to
     pursue the core objectives of EU external engagement; stresses that cooperation
     between both partners will be useful in addressing these global problems; reiterates that
     China remains an important partner for the EU;

3.   Supports greater dialogue and cooperation with China on peace and security; recognises
     the importance of cooperating with China to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a new
     terrorist base and discourage North Korea from continuing its nuclear programme;
     endorses seeking cooperation on sustainable development, contributions to
     humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, environmental issues, space and aerospace,
     science, technology and innovation, while fully insisting on freedom of research;
     stresses that these dialogues and cooperation must be founded on a shared commitment
     to openness and working together in a transparent, just and equitable manner as part of a
     rules-based international system, while making sure that European interests and values
     are safeguarded and developing Europe’s ability to compete with China wherever
     necessary;

4.   Points out that some fields of cooperation such as ICT, space and aerospace can have a
     dual use application and can be used against Chinese citizens and the West;

5.   Underlines the importance of encouraging China’s commitment to tackling climate
     change and other environmental issues by reinforcing an EU-China partnership in this
     field and emphasises the need to ensure that both EU and China adhere to their
     respective commitments under the Paris Agreement; stresses the importance of the EU
     implementing a carbon border adjustment mechanism; notes that over the past three
     decades China has tripled its carbon emissions and it is now emitting 27 % of the
     world’s greenhouse gases; stresses the need to ensure coherence between China’s
     announced global ambitions in the fight against climate change and the environmental
     impacts of its investment strategies at home and overseas; calls on the Chinese
     Government to refrain from exporting its coal capacity to third countries, notably in the
     framework of the BRI;

6.   Calls for result-oriented Human Rights Dialogues to be held on an annual basis and
     evaluated regularly and calls for a solid benchmarking of the progress made in bilateral
     dialogues more generally to ensure that these exchanges produce genuine positive
     outcomes for human rights and human rights defenders in China; asks for the
     benchmarking results and any progress, stagnation or deterioration to be discussed in a
     transparent manner; requests that human rights be regularly raised at the highest
     political level, both at EU-China Summits and at Member State level; calls,
     furthermore, for a shadow human rights dialogue, involving EU and Member State
     diplomats, the Chinese diaspora, free and independent NGOs, academics and
     lawmakers, aimed at forging a better understanding of the Chinese system and devising
     better strategies to influence human rights progress in China; underlines that these
     Human Rights Dialogues need to include, but must not be limited to, the following
     issues: media freedom and freedom of the press, the rights of minorities, including in
     the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Tibet, and free access to these regions
     including for diplomats and journalists, the situation of Hong Kong, freedom of speech,
     labour rights, the right of assembly, freedom of religion or belief, and the state of the
     rule of law in China in general; welcomes the appointment of a new EU Special Envoy
     for the Promotion of Freedom of Religion or Belief Outside the Union, and calls for the
     new Special Envoy to be actively involved in supporting the plight of all religious
     groups and entities, including Muslims, Christians and Buddhists, facing persecution in
     mainland China and Hong Kong; calls for the relevant EU institutions to use these
     Human Rights Dialogues to bring up individual cases; remains deeply concerned about
     the continuing detention of Swedish citizen and publisher Gui Minhai; urges an
     intervention by the EU and the Member States at the highest level to secure the
     immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners; expresses concern about
     systemic human rights violations in China and condemns all cases of arbitrary arrests
     and suppression of the free flow of information and freedom of expression;

7.   Calls for the EU to engage in dialogue with China on possible ways to improve, in a
     transparent manner, initial response capabilities for infectious diseases that have the
     potential to develop into epidemics or pandemics, including recognition, risk-mapping
     and early warning systems to ensure better global preparedness to respond to
     pandemics; calls further on China to allow an independent and transparent investigation
     into the origins and spread of SARS-COV-2;

8.   Supports the expansion of contacts between peoples on both sides as well as mutual
     student exchange visits, but encourages the Member States to better monitor the impact
     of Chinese Government interference in academic freedom;

Enhanced engagement on universal values, international norms and human rights

9.    Condemns in the strongest possible terms the baseless and arbitrary sanctions imposed
      by the Chinese authorities, which amount to an attack on freedom of speech, on
      academic freedom, and on the international commitment to and understanding of
      universal human rights; urges the Chinese authorities to lift these unjustified sanctions;
      considers that sanctions imposed by the Chinese authorities further erode trust and
      hinder bilateral cooperation;

10.   Underlines that the consideration and ratification process for the EU-China
      Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) cannot start until the Chinese
      sanctions against MEPs and EU institutions have been lifted;

11.   Highlights, in this context, its resolution of 20 May 2021 on Chinese countersanctions;
      calls on the Commission, in line with Parliament’s resolution of 20 May 2021 on
      Chinese countersanctions and with Article 21(1) of the Treaty on European Union
      (TEU), to use all the tools at its disposal and the debate around the CAI as leverage to
      improve the protection of human rights and support for civil society in China; urges
      China to take concrete measures towards putting an end to other human rights violations
      in China, such as forced labour and the systematic persecution of Uyghurs and other
      Turkic Muslim minority groups, Tibetans, Christians and other religious communities
      and churches, and to uphold its international commitments to Hong Kong under the
      Sino-British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong’s Basic Law through the suspension of
      planned reforms to the city’s electoral system and the release of pro-democracy
      legislators and activists; also calls on China to respect the Basic Law of Macau, which
      will be in force until 2049, and the provisions of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration1
      preventing any interference in the country’s electoral processes and the functioning of
      the media;

12.   Underlines that Parliament would take the human rights situation in China, including in
      Hong Kong, into account before determining its position; reiterates its very serious
      concerns about the various human rights abuses in China and recalls that full respect for
      universal values is essential, regardless of the differences between both systems;

13.   Calls on China to abide by international standards including with regard to its impact on
      climate, the environment, biodiversity, poverty, health, labour rights and human rights;
      urges China, in the context of promoting sustainable trade and development, to take
      concrete action towards the ratification and implementation of the four outstanding
      fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the
      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; regrets the fact that several
      international companies, notably in the apparel and textile sector, have been subject to
      an extensive and widespread boycott after expressing concerns about the reports of
      forced labour in Xinjiang and taking the decision to cut supply chain ties with Xinjiang,
      and strongly condemns the political coercion exercised against them by the Chinese
      Government; reiterates its request for the Commission and the European External
      Action Service (EEAS) to swiftly finalise a supply chain business advisory with
      guidance for companies on the exposure to risks of using Uyghur forced labour and
      providing support in urgently identifying alternative sources of supply;


1     China and Portugal Joint Declaration of 13 April 1987 on the question of Macao.

14.   Underlines the need to ensure that the internal market legislation, as well as any due
      diligence framework or forced labour import ban, be efficiently and effectively used in
      order to exclude entities operating on the EU internal market that are directly or
      indirectly involved in human rights abuses in Xinjiang; calls further on European
      companies in China, as part of their corporate responsibility, to undertake a thorough
      investigation into the use of forced labour in their supply chains;

15.   Urges the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to launch independent legal
      investigations into alleged genocide, alleged crimes against humanity and human rights
      violations, including forced labour programmes taking place in several regions in China,
      and calls for the EU and its Member States to provide their political backing and garner
      international support for such an investigation; calls on the Chinese authorities to allow
      free, meaningful and unhindered access to the region; is extremely concerned about
      reports of labour programmes in Tibet, which are also being labelled ‘vocational
      training camps’ by the Chinese authorities; calls on China to comply with its obligations
      under national and international law to respect human rights, including the rights of
      minorities in Xinjiang, Tibet and Inner Mongolia;

16.   Condemns the fact that freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of
      the press are severely restricted in China; deplores the political persecution to which
      many journalists – who are now in exile – have been subjected; calls on China to ensure
      that all journalists can conduct their work freely, without impediments and fear of
      reprisals; stresses that the freedom of the press and media should be ensured; requests
      that the EU support free speech and free media in China by establishing a European
      Democratic Media Fund to support independent journalism;

17.   Calls on the Commission to bring forward the proposed Mandatory Human Rights Due
      Diligence Framework as a matter of urgency and to support efforts to achieve the
      adoption of a similar instrument in the framework of the United Nations;

18.   Calls on the Commission to express its concern over the new Order 15, further
      constraining religious people and their leaders, to the Chinese authorities;

19.   Calls on the Member States to fully implement the package of measures that was agreed
      following the introduction of the National Security Law for Hong Kong in July 2020
      and to review their asylum, migration, visa and residence policies for Hong Kongers;
      urges the VP/HR and the Council to assess and update the conclusions on Hong Kong;
      calls for targeted measures under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, as
      necessary, in order to address repression in Hong Kong; calls furthermore for the repeal
      by China of the National Security Law imposed on Hong Kong in June 2020; calls on
      those Member States which continue to have extradition treaties with China and Hong
      Kong in force to suspend individual extraditions wherever the extradition of an
      individual puts them at risk of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
      punishment, where that individual would face charges for politically motivated reasons,
      in other situations where ethnic minorities, representatives of the pro-democratic
      opposition in Hong Kong and dissidents in general would be targeted, and wherever this
      would be in breach of the EU’s obligations under the European Convention on Human
      Rights;

20.   Recommends that the leadership of the EU and the Member States decline invitations to
      the Beijing Winter Olympics in the event that the human rights situation in China and

      Hong Kong does not improve and no high-level EU-China Human Rights
      Summit/Dialogue with a tangible outcome takes place prior to the event;

21.   Regrets China’s support for the most oppressive regimes in the world, in particular in
      Syria, Iran and North Korea, but also in Venezuela and Cuba;

Analysis and identification of the risks, vulnerabilities and challenges

22.   Believes that the future EU strategy on China should provide the necessary tools and
      data to address the political, economic, social and technological threats stemming from
      China, including via its BRI, Dual Circulation Strategy, 14th Five-Year Plan, and Made
      in China 2025, China Standards 2035 and 16+1 policies, including its military
      modernisation and capacity build-up, and the implications of this for the Union’s open
      strategic autonomy and for the multilateral rules-based order; notes that there is an
      urgent need to ensure political will and resources for the implementation of the EU’s
      Connectivity Strategy; calls for greater coordination between the EU’s Connectivity
      Strategy and the Blue Dot Network in order to provide a sustainable alternative to the
      BRI; welcomes the G7 leaders’ agreement to develop a partnership to build back better
      for the world – the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative – as an alternative to
      China’s BRI; calls for EU Member States and institutions to embrace the initiative and
      contribute to it;

23.   Calls on the Commission to commission an EU-wide audit, broken down by Member
      State, of EU dependency on China in certain strategically important and critical sectors,
      including pharmaceutical supplies, if possible at both national and subnational level,
      building on its recent comprehensive analysis entitled ‘Strategic dependencies and
      capacities’ (SWD(2021)0352), which sets out plans to reduce risks related to undesired
      dependencies, while maintaining overall relations with China, which should be as
      reciprocal and balanced as possible and aligned with the EU’s values and strategic
      priorities;

24.   Calls on the Commission and the Council to elaborate mechanisms to address these
      threats coherently, in particular by:

      (a)   ensuring the EU’s unity at Member State level, which is needed to be able to
            properly implement the new EU-China strategy; calling on all Member States to
            uphold the EU’s core values;

      (b)   building on the EU toolbox for national, regional and local risk-mitigating
            measures to develop global standards in partnership with like-minded partners for
            the new generation of technologies in accordance with democratic values, such as
            5G and 6G networks, and ensuring that companies that do not fulfil security
            standards are excluded from 5G and 6G network development;

      (c)   strengthening the EU’s capabilities in pursuit of global leadership, including
            through cooperation with like-minded partners;

      (d)   ensuring institutional coordination between the Commission, the Council and the
            EEAS before BRI-related events, and cooperating with Member States to ensure
            that the decisions taken by those involved in the initiative are in line with EU
            policies and interests and respect fundamental EU values; stresses that

            consultations must take place at EU level, for example through a joint Trade
            Policy Committee-Political and Security Committee meeting at Council level,
            before BRI-related events in order to ensure that Member States speak with one
            voice; stresses that the BRI must meet international standards; underlines that BRI
            projects must be closely monitored, including with regard to their negative
            political effects in the EU;

      (e)   monitoring key infrastructure contracts in Member States and accession countries
            to ensure their conformity with EU legislation, as well as their alignment with the
            EU’s strategic interests, as defined by the EU-China strategy; protecting critical
            infrastructure from the influence of third countries, which could be detrimental to
            the EU and its Member States’ economic and security interests;

25.   Underlines that the bilateral and uncoordinated engagement of some Member States
      with China, and the failure to inform the Commission when signing Memoranda of
      Understanding with third countries, is counterproductive and damaging to the EU’s
      global position and the advantage its Member States have in the negotiations when
      acting as a Union rather than independent state actors; asks Member States to refrain
      from signing any such memoranda without consulting the Council and the Commission;
      calls for the establishment of a coordination mechanism at EU level to deal with such
      issues; recalls Article 24 TEU, which notes that the ‘Member States shall support the
      Union’s external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and
      mutual solidarity’, and that they ‘shall refrain from any action which is contrary to the
      interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in
      international relations’;

26.   Stresses that the implementation of the EU-China strategy and national strategies and
      policies towards China should be regularly coordinated between the EU institutions, the
      Member States, the different Commission Directorates General and the European
      Parliament, in order to ensure a comprehensive and consistent policy that avoids
      compartmentalisation of separate policy areas; believes that policies should also be
      coordinated with regional and local actors that develop and maintain links with China;

27.   Expresses concern about the increasing incidence of hybrid attacks, Chinese industrial
      espionage and cyber theft against European companies; stresses the importance of
      strengthening private and public cyber capabilities; calls for stronger cooperation and
      the establishment of a system aimed at ending malicious acts in cyber space on the part
      of China, including cyberattacks, forced technology transfers, cyber-espionage and
      cyber-enabled intellectual property theft; underscores the need to foster closer
      cooperation with NATO and G7 countries to fight hybrid threats, including cyber
      attacks, and disinformation campaigns stemming from China, including by allowing
      Member States to impose collective countermeasures on a voluntary basis, even if the
      nature of the attacks is not serious enough to trigger Article 5 of the NATO Treaty or
      Article 42(7) TEU;

28.   Calls on the Commission to encourage and coordinate actions aimed at countering
      China’s foreign financing of our democratic processes, including the strategy of elite
      capture and the technique of co-opting top-level civil servants and former EU
      politicians;

29.   Is concerned by the assertive and, at times, aggressive diplomatic pressure from the
      Chinese authorities, e.g. towards the President of the Czech Senate; stresses that EU
      institutions can in no way bow to pressure, threats or censorship from Chinese channels;
      is concerned about undue pressure by Chinese officials on researchers and academics
      working on topics related to China across the EU, including the activities of the
      Confucius Institutes in the EU;

Building partnerships with like-minded partners

30.   Calls on the VP/HR to coordinate the Union’s actions with like-minded partners on the
      protection of human rights and support for people in China, Hong Kong and Macau, and
      for the Chinese diaspora around the world, as well as the defence of liberal democracy
      in the world, notably in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and with a view to engaging China to
      respect international law, the right to public demonstrations as an exercise of freedom of
      expression and freedom of assembly, the freedom of navigation, including in the South
      China and East China Seas, overflight and the peaceful resolution of disputes;
      underlines, further, that such partnerships and multilateral cooperation with like-minded
      partners should encompass all elements and measures outlined in the new EU-China
      strategy;

31.   Expresses grave concern over China’s assertive and expansionist policies in the South
      China Sea, East China Sea and Taiwan Strait, especially China’s continued military
      provocation aimed at Taiwan; underlines that the status quo across the Taiwan Strait
      and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region are of critical importance to the
      EU and its Member States; reiterates its opposition to any unilateral actions that could
      escalate tensions and undermine the status quo; encourages the constructive
      development of cross-strait relations and stresses any change to cross-strait relations
      must not be made against the will of Taiwan’s citizens; echoes the concerns expressed
      by Japan and the US over a new law in China that authorises Chinese coastguard ships
      to use weapons against foreign vessels violating what China considers to be its territory;
      calls for the EU to address these issues in both the new EU-China strategy and the EU
      strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, and to increase multilateral diplomatic
      exchanges in order to achieve the peaceful resolution of disputes and controversies in
      accordance with international law, including UNCLOS;

32.   Calls for the Member States to invest in stronger cooperation with other democratic and
      like-minded partners such as the US, Canada, the UK, Japan, India, South Korea,
      Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan, and calls on the EEAS and the Member States to
      prioritise and strengthen the Strategic Partnerships with ASEAN and the African Union;

33.   Considers it of primary importance for the EU to develop and promote an ambitious and
      dynamic transatlantic relationship with the US Government, based on our shared
      history, values and interests, in the framework of a Transatlantic Dialogue on China,
      including a parliamentary dimension; highlights the importance of the EU-US
      partnership in maintaining and demonstrating the united strength of global liberal
      democracies, including through our work in multilateral organisations; emphasises in
      this regard that the new EU-US Dialogue on China should be one of the mechanisms for
      advancing our shared interests and managing our differences, and for reforming
      multilateral organisations within the framework of the rules-based order; believes that
      the EU should continue to strengthen the Union’s operational autonomy and resilience
      toward external threats;

34.   Underlines the importance of the EU remaining attentive to China’s changing role and
      growing global influence in multilateral organisations, including the UN, to which
      China is the second biggest financial contributor, and to ensure better coordination
      among the Member States and like-minded partners towards combining the strength of
      global liberal democracies, in order to respond to this development; notes that the
      Chinese Government’s greater engagement with international and multilateral
      institutions, such as the UN, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Health
      Organization (WHO), Interpol, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International
      Telecommunication Union and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),
      including standard-setting bodies, aims to reshape norms, standard and practices
      globally in order to foster China’s long-term geopolitical strategy and economic
      interests; regrets that Chinese domestic censorship, now being exercised, inter alia, at
      the UN, aims to manipulate procedures to minimise scrutiny of China’s conduct, in
      particular in the case of the situation of ethnic Uyghur Muslims and other Turkic
      Muslim minorities; calls for the EU to work with like-minded partners to counter these
      developments;

35.   Stresses that China is the largest provider of peacekeepers among the five permanent
      members of the UN Security Council, but has refused to adopt sections of Chapter VII
      of the UN Charter and the pillar of Responsibility to Protect (R2P); underlines that the
      EU has integrated R2P into its external action;

36.   Calls for stronger EU cooperation with NATO on Chinese security challenges; supports
      NATO’s proposal to develop a political strategy for approaching a world in which
      China will be a global superpower; requests that this strategy be based on different
      scenarios for the development of relations with China, including the possibility of the
      further deterioration of security in the South China Sea, and calls for dialogue and
      coordination with the countries of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue; welcomes
      NATO’s efforts to carefully monitor the security implications of China’s increased
      physical presence in the Arctic, as well as in Africa; recommends that EU-NATO
      cooperation on security challenges related to China be sufficiently taken into account
      while elaborating the EU Strategic Compass and reviewing the NATO Strategic
      Concept;

37.   Welcomes the Council’s intention to reinforce the EU’s strategic focus, presence and
      action in the Indo-Pacific by launching a new EU strategy for cooperation in the Indo-
      Pacific, as well as a new strategy for connectivity; notes that any such new strategy
      should be in conformity with the EU-China strategy;

38.   Deems it pertinent for the Commission to provide timely and comprehensive reports on
      the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) – the world’s largest free
      trade agreement – in order to assess developments on the ground; is particularly
      interested in the implications for the EU’s strategic interests of matters such as standard-
      setting in the Asia-Pacific as well as provisions on rules of origin; notes that while the
      EU is not a party to RCEP, the agreement will have implications for the EU; highlights
      the absence of provisions in RCEP on trade and sustainability, including labour and
      social standards and climate and environmental objectives;

39.   Recalls, in the context of the regional dynamics, the importance of trade and economic
      relations between the EU and Taiwan, including on matters relating to multilateralism
      and the WTO, technology and public health, as well as essential cooperation on critical

      supplies such as semiconductors; notes that Taiwan is a full member of the WTO;
      reiterates its call on and urges the Commission and the Council to move towards a
      bilateral investment agreement with Taiwan and to urgently begin the impact
      assessment, public consultation, and scoping exercise with the Taiwanese authorities;

40.   Urges the Commission to come up with concrete proposals and action to facilitate
      Taiwan’s full participation as an observer in the meetings, mechanism and activities of
      the WHO, the ICAO and the UNFCCC;

Fostering open strategic autonomy, including in trade and investment relations

41.   Underlines that investment and trade conditionality by itself is not enough to counter
      Chinese assertiveness; finds that the EU should increase strategic autonomy by
      addressing other dimensions of the EU-China relationship, notably digital and
      technological sovereignty; underlines, in this context, the need to invest in innovation
      and research and to develop a competitive and sovereign industrial strategy in areas
      including, yet not limited to, microchips and semiconductor production, rare earth
      mining, cloud computing and telecoms technology, in order to decrease the EU’s
      reliance on China, always with view to ensuring better coordination of those policies
      with those of other like-minded liberal democracies, while exploring the potential to
      pool resources and create new synergies;

42.   Notes that in 2020, in the context of COVID-19, China ranked as the EU’s largest
      partner for trade in goods for the first time, with the trade balance further deteriorating
      to the EU’s detriment; recalls, however, that the US is still the EU’s top partner in trade
      in goods and services combined; believes that China’s economic rise and predicted
      growth will have a considerable impact on global economic developments over the next
      decade; points out that for different reasons, mutual investment levels remain below
      their potential and recognises the economic opportunities that characterise the wider
      region; considers that the volume of trade between China and the EU will require a
      rules-based and values-driven framework which needs to be rooted in international
      norms; stresses that respect for human rights is a prerequisite for engaging in trade and
      investment relations with the EU and urges China to comply with its international
      obligations and to commit to respecting human rights;

43.   Underlines the key role of the European Parliament in the EU’s common commercial
      policy, in international negotiations, and in the oversight, scrutiny, ratification and
      monitoring of the implementation of trade and investment agreements; highlights the
      need for the Committee on International Trade to be consulted in a timely and proper
      manner and urges the Commission and the Council to maintain frequent dialogue and
      carry out comprehensive reporting, reflecting developments on the EU-China bilateral
      trade and investment agenda;

44.   Underlines the importance of the EU’s strategic trade and investment relationship with
      China and calls for the EU Member States and institutions to address China with one
      voice and in a coordinated manner; considers that investment initiatives under the 16+1
      format must not undermine the unity of the EU, nor be counterproductive to efforts to
      speak with one voice;

45.   Calls on the Commission to analyse the EU’s economic dependencies in strategic
      sectors, such as critical raw materials, some of which are located exclusively in China,

      and highlights the urgent need to boost the resilience of European supply chains; calls
      for efforts to diversify and consolidate the EU’s access to the key strategic resources
      needed to power the EU’s twin engines of growth, with a particular emphasis on the 30
      elements included in the fourth, updated list of critical raw materials in 2020; recalls the
      overall EU objective to build its open strategic autonomy under the common
      commercial policy; reiterates the increasing significance of the trade-security nexus in
      the EU’s international trade policy;

46.   Calls for greater transparency, coherence and coordination between the Member States
      on matters related to bilateral investment projects and deals, particularly on foreign
      direct investment (FDI) in strategic assets and critical infrastructure; draws attention to
      the links between economic dependencies and external political leverage at the level of
      the Member States; recalls the importance of strengthening the EU FDI Screening
      Regulation in the future in order to make sure that any potential investments that could
      pose a threat to the EU’s security and public order, in particular by state-controlled
      enterprises, are blocked; calls on the Member States to urgently adopt a national
      screening mechanism if they do not have one yet, in line with the Commission guidance
      from March 2020;

47.   Is convinced that the EU-China bilateral trade and investment relationship is of strategic
      importance and should be rules-based, with the multilateral trading system and the
      principle of reciprocity at its core; reiterates that while there are concerning trends
      towards economic decoupling, a more assertive enforcement of and adherence to
      commitments is necessary in the overall trade and investment relationship; calls on
      China to play a more active and responsible part in the WTO and other multilateral
      initiatives, matching its economic power with its level of development, and to fully
      adhere to all of its WTO and international obligations; calls on the Commission and the
      Chinese authorities to cooperate closely to reform the WTO rulebook in order to foster a
      more sustainable development, promote the green transition and digital revolution, and
      bring stability and legal certainty to the international trade arena;

48.   Is concerned about the increasingly unbalanced bilateral economic and trade
      relationship between the EU and China; stresses that rebalancing and a more level
      playing field are vital to EU interests; believes that China and the EU must build a level
      playing field and forge a fruitful relationship in spite of the differences between their
      respective economic systems; highlights, in this regard, the EU’s ongoing work in
      strengthening its trade toolbox, while recognising the need to maintain an open dialogue
      on common challenges such as the global fight against climate change; stresses the
      urgent need for the EU to complete its range of autonomous measures including a more
      stringent EU FDI Screening Regulation, legislation on foreign subsidies that distort the
      internal market, the swift adoption of an assertive and effective international
      procurement instrument, measures on the export of dual-use technology, an effective
      anti-coercion instrument, a package of sustainable corporate governance legislation, and
      supply chain legislation with mandatory due diligence requirements, which should also
      provide for an import ban on forced labour goods; believes that additional targeted
      measures under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime should be considered
      as necessary;

49.   Repeats its deep concern about the many barriers that European businesses face when
      accessing and operating on the Chinese market; is worried that China’s ‘dual circulation
      strategy’ referred to in its 14th Five-Year Plan will further deteriorate the business

      environment for EU companies; highlights, once again, its particular concern about the
      market distorting practices such as, but not limited to, industrial subsidies, the beneficial
      treatment of Chinese state-owned enterprises, intellectual property theft, forced
      technology transfers and data localisation, industrial overcapacity in sectors such as
      steel and the related dumping of exports, other unfair trading practices and the overall
      increasing political interference in the business environment, including the private
      sector; calls on the Commission and the Member States to step up their cooperation
      with like-minded partners at the WTO to develop a joint approach to tackle these unfair
      Chinese trading practices; welcomes the EU-US dialogue on China as a means to
      cooperate on topics such as reciprocity, multilateralism, market-distorting practices and
      the economy and other structural issues where EU-US coordination can bring an added
      value; is convinced of the vital significance of proper information on the legislative and
      regulatory developments on the Chinese market, given its opaque and state-driven
      nature; recalls, in this context, the importance of frequent and frank discussions with EU
      institutions, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China and all our partners
      on the ground;

50.   Considers it pertinent to specifically discuss the negative trade-related effects of and
      possible remedies for distortions caused by the global excess capacity of steel and
      aluminium, alongside the importance of tackling industrial subsidies at the WTO; urges
      China to re-engage in the work of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity in order
      to eliminate overcapacity and restore a level playing field; notes that despite China’s
      plans to close down outdated production sites and modernise production, its annual
      crude steel output has set a record for four straight years; encourages the Chinese
      authorities to follow through with their pledges to reduce the output of crude steel;

51.   Reminds, in this regard, of the links between trade, patents and standards; believes that
      standardisation and the normative elements of increasing international competition are
      essential for the EU’s trade policy and should be one the key pillars of its strategic
      industrial policy; recalls that standardisation is being reported as an area of risk where
      China may diverge and decouple; highlights that counterfeiting is a top priority for the
      EU’s efforts in the commercial aspects of intellectual property protection; is concerned
      that China remains at the origin of a dominant share of counterfeit and pirated goods
      arriving in the EU in terms of both value and volume; underlines how the EU-China
      Agreement on Geographical Indications (GIs) represents a first step in the fight against
      counterfeiting and urges the Commission to step up its efforts to protect the EU’s
      intellectual property, including patents; is concerned about the emerging practice of
      Chinese courts claiming worldwide jurisdiction over the determination of fair,
      reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing terms for standard essential patents, and
      barring companies from challenging their decisions; underlines that this practice
      amounts to allowing Chinese companies not to pay a fair price for the use of standard
      essential patents and endangers European research; asks the Commission to engage with
      the Chinese authorities on this matter; calls for closer attention to be devoted to
      infringements in the fields of digitalisation and communications within all the relevant
      bodies, including the UN’s International Telecommunication Union, together with the
      EU’s like-minded partners, in particular the US; calls for more policy discussions about
      the implications of Chinese initiatives such as Made in China 2025 or, increasingly
      pertinently, China Standards 2035; is concerned, in this context, about China’s
      increasing digital authoritarianism and its efforts to promote its digital governance
      model around the world; emphasises the need to conclude the WTO E-Commerce

      Agreement under the Joint Statement Initiative in order to promote a basic level of
      openness and a level playing field with China;

52.   Calls for greater attention to be paid to European SMEs that engage in commercial and
      investment relations with China and welcomes the Commission’s support for SME-
      friendly initiatives such as the Access2Markets portal, the Rules of Origin Self-
      Assessment (ROSA) tool or the China Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) SME
      helpdesk;

53.   Takes note of the conclusion in principle, at political level, of the EU-China CAI, while
      acknowledging the Commission’s efforts to address shortcomings linked to market
      access asymmetries, a level playing field and sustainable development through rules-
      based engagement; recalls, however, that trade relations do not take place in a vacuum;

54.   Calls on the Commission to consult with Parliament before taking any steps towards the
      conclusion and signature of the CAI; urges China to take concrete steps towards
      ratifying and implementing the fundamental ILO Conventions Nos 29 and 105 on
      forced labour; highlights that China has also committed to effectively implementing the
      ratified ILO Conventions and to working towards the ratification of other ‘up-to-date’
      fundamental ILO Conventions;

55.   Notes that 26 EU Member States have old-style bilateral investment treaties with China;

56.   Recalls, however, that the CAI alone would not solve all issues ailing our economic and
      political relationship, and therefore has to be considered in the context of a strengthened
      and more assertive EU toolbox of unilateral measures; underlines that the European
      Parliament would scrutinise the agreement thoroughly, including the section on
      sustainable development;

57.   Stresses that proper implementation and effective enforcement would be key
      determinants of the utility and success of the agreement in redressing structural
      asymmetries in the trade and investment relationship; highlights the role and relevance
      of structured and frequent exchanges with the office of the Commission’s Chief Trade
      Enforcement Officer (CTEO) in efforts to evaluate the future implementation of the
      CAI provided it is adopted; recalls and reinforces, in this context, the importance of
      parliamentary diplomacy in facilitating mutual understanding, transparent
      communication and honest dialogue;

58.   Welcomes the entry into force of the EU-China Agreement on GIs and reiterates the
      importance of its effective implementation and enforcement on the markets of both
      parties; welcomes the anticipated expansion of the current agreement to add a further
      350 GI names from both sides; underlines that this limited agreement on GIs could
      serve as a model and basis for future GI agreements; highlights the crucial role that the
      CTEO will play in monitoring and improving compliance with the agreement; calls on
      the CTEO to respond immediately should the agreement not be implemented correctly;

59.   Emphasises that China still has a long way to go before it is a free market economy,
      given the extreme influence the state has on the economy and on businesses’ decisions
      relating to prices, costs, production and inputs; calls on China, therefore, to take more
      open-minded measures with regard to its own firms and foreign firms operating in the
      country;

60.   Calls for increased funding for 5G rollout projects and research into 6G, artificial
      intelligence (AI) and big data technology, in order to ensure future network security and
      increased digital sovereignty which will be vital for digitalisation and economic growth,
      but also for closing the technological gap with China and for eliminating the risks that
      NATO members and its partners may be exposed to with the integration of China’s 5G
      technology into the telecommunication networks, as such action could erode the future
      of democratic governance; calls further for a coordinated EU cybersecurity strategy and
      for an increase in the Member States’ capabilities in this field, in order, inter alia, to
      strengthen protection against threats to the EU’s critical infrastructure emanating from
      third countries, including China;

61.   Underlines the importance of working on AI regulation and on an ethical and civil
      liability framework for AI systems and affiliated technologies that boosts human-
      centred and privacy-sensitive innovation, in partnership with key strategic partners that
      share the EU’s liberal and democratic values; underlines that systems of social scoring
      are not in line with the EU’s fundamental values; stresses the need for the EU to
      preserve the rights of the individual; stresses, therefore, that such policies and tools of
      surveillance should under no circumstances be used in the EU; underlines, therefore,
      that the EU must work to limit and counter the transnational reach of digital repression;

Defence and promotion of core European interests and values by transforming the EU into
a more effective geopolitical actor

62.   Believes that the EU should continue working towards becoming a more effective
      geopolitical player by ensuring a more united geopolitical approach of its Member
      States, as well as by fostering its strategic autonomy and capacity, working together
      with the US and other like-minded partners;

63.   Highlights that the success of the European neighbourhood policy determines the EU’s
      capacity to take on the role of global actor; warns of the increasing role of China in the
      immediate neighbourhood of the EU, including candidate countries; calls for a strategic
      approach at EU level to counter Chinese actions through investments, loans and
      business activities in neighbouring countries, in particular in the Western Balkans; calls
      in particular for active EU engagement in providing these countries with a viable
      alternative to Chinese investments;

64.   Points to the need to strengthen the EU’s tools to defend itself, increase its capacity to
      protect its interests overseas, play a more proactive, consistent and strategic role in its
      direct neighbourhood and ensure that the Member States are united in their geopolitical
      approach;

65.   Believes that the Conference on the Future of Europe should provide a forum for debate
      on the EU’s external action, such as on issues relating to the protection of human rights,
      and to discuss how to achieve open strategic autonomy; underlines the importance of
      discussing issues linked to improving and strengthening the EU’s common foreign and
      security policy, for instance by giving the VP/HR a stronger mandate to act on behalf of
      the EU in foreign policy matters and take the necessary steps to introduce qualified
      majority voting in certain areas of foreign affairs; calls for defence cooperation among
      the Member States to be strengthened, with the goal of enhancing European strategic
      defence capabilities, as well as of creating a fully-fledged European Defence Union,
      which would include European military capabilities;

66.   Points out the need to equip the EEAS with a mandate and the necessary resources to
      monitor and address Chinese disinformation operations, including the creation of a
      dedicated Far-East StratCom Task Force focused on disinformation emanating from
      China; calls on China to refrain from covert means of manipulating public discourse in
      the EU; encourages the Commission to develop an EU-wide regulatory system to
      prevent media companies either funded or controlled by third-country governments
      from acquiring European media companies, in order to preserve independent and free
      media reporting in the EU; suggests diversifying Chinese-language media in Europe by
      encouraging cooperation between European media and international partners, such as
      Taiwan; stresses further the urgent need to significantly boost expert capacity on China
      in the EEAS and the Commission in general;

67.   Points out the importance of independent studies and research on China in universities,
      think tanks, research institutions and schools across the EU, free from Chinese financial
      support or influence, ensuring academic integrity and freedom of speech; calls on the
      EU, therefore, to develop a programme to finance China-related research and language
      training in the EU;

68.   Points out the need to introduce, independently from the CPC’s influence, programmes
      for the study of Chinese culture, language and politics, for example through closer
      contacts with Taiwanese academia and society;

69.   Calls on the Commission to take into account and include in its strategy China’s rapidly
      growing interest and involvement in the Arctic; calls for preparedness to ensure
      freedom of navigation on the Arctic’s Northern Sea Route; takes note of China’s
      investments in research and strategic infrastructure in the Arctic and notes that the EU
      should not lose ground in this important region;

                                                °

                                            °       °

70.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the
      Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign
      Affairs and Security Policy, and, for information, to the Government of the People’s
      Republic of China.

    2017 on the cases of Nobel laureate Liu Xiabo and Lee Ming-che2 and of 18 January
    2018 on the cases of human rights activists Wu Gan, Xie Yang, Lee Ming-che and Tashi
    Wangchuk, and the Tibetan monk Choekyi3 ,

– having regard to the EU arms embargo introduced after the Tiananmen crackdown of
  June 1989, as supported by Parliament in its resolution of 2 February 2006 on the annual
  report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices
  of CFSP4 ,

– having regard to the nine rounds of talks held from 2002 to 2010 between high-ranking
  representatives of the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama, to China’s White Paper
  on Tibet entitled ‘Tibet’s Path of Development Is Driven by an Irresistible Historical
  Tide’ and published by China’s State Council Information Office on 15 April 2015, and to
  the 2008 Memorandum and the 2009 Note on Genuine Autonomy, both presented by the
  representatives of the 14th Dalai Lama,

– having regard to Rule 52 of its Rules of Procedure,

– having regard to the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the opinions of the
  Committee on International Trade and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health
  and Food Safety (A8-0252/2018),

A. whereas the 19th EU-China Summit in 2017 advanced a bilateral strategic partnership,
   which has a global impact, and highlighted joint commitments to addressing global
   challenges, common security threats and the promotion of multilateralism; whereas there
   are many areas where constructive cooperation could bring mutual benefits, including in
   international fora such as the UN and G20; whereas the EU and China have confirmed
   their intention to step up cooperation on the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement
   in combating climate change, cutting back on fossil fuels, promoting clean energy and
   reducing pollution; whereas further cooperation and coordination between the two sides in
   this sector is needed, including in the field of research and the exchange of best practices;
   whereas China has adopted a carbon emissions trading scheme based on the EU’s ETS;
   whereas the EU’s vision for multilateral governance is one of a rules-based order and
   based on universal values such as democracy, human rights, the rule of law, transparency
   and accountability; whereas in the current geopolitical context, it is more important than
   ever to promote multilateralism and a rules-based system; whereas the EU expects its
   relationship with China to be one of reciprocal benefit in both political and economic
   terms; whereas it expects China to assume responsibilities in line with its global impact
   and to support the rules-based international order from which it, too, benefits;

B. whereas cooperation between the EU and China on foreign policy, security and defence,
   and in the fight against terrorism is extremely important; whereas cooperation between the
   two sides was essential in securing the Iranian nuclear deal; whereas China’s stance
   played a key role in creating space for negotiations in the North Korean crisis;

C. whereas largely ignored in Europe, the Chinese leadership has gradually and
   systematically stepped up its efforts to translate its economic weight into political
   influence, notably through strategic infrastructure investments and new transport links, as
   well as strategic communication aimed at influencing European political and economic
   decision-makers, the media, universities and academic publishers and the wider public in
   order to shape perceptions about China and convey a positive image of the country, by
   building up ‘networks’ of supportive European organisations and individuals across
   societies; whereas China’s surveillance of the large number of mainland students now
   studying across Europe is cause for concern as are its efforts to control people in Europe
   who have fled China;

D. whereas the 16+1 format between China on one hand, and 11 Central and Eastern
   European Countries (CEEs) and five Balkan countries on the other, was established in
   2012 in the aftermath of the financial crisis and as part of Chinese sub-regional diplomacy
   to develop large-scale infrastructure projects and strengthen economic and trade
   cooperation; whereas planned Chinese investment and funding in these countries is
   substantial, but not as important as EU investment and engagement; whereas European
   countries participating in this format should consider giving greater weight to the notion
   of one voice for the EU in its relations with China;

E. whereas China is the fastest-growing market for EU food products;

F. whereas China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including China’s Arctic Policy, is the
   most ambitious foreign policy initiative the country has ever adopted, comprising
   geopolitical and security-related dimensions and therefore going beyond the claimed
   scope of economic and trade policy; whereas BRI was further strengthened with the
   establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2015; whereas the
   EU insists on a multilateral governance structure and on non-discriminatory
   implementation of the BRI; whereas the European side wishes to guarantee that any
   connectivity project under BRI will honour the obligations stemming from the Paris
   accord as well as ensure that other international environmental, labour and social
   standards and the rights of indigenous people are upheld; whereas the Chinese
   infrastructure projects could create large debts for the European governments to Chinese
   state-owned banks offering loans on non-transparent terms and create few jobs in Europe;
   whereas some BRI-related infrastructure projects have already placed third governments
   in a state of over-indebtedness; whereas so far the lion’s share of all BRI-related contracts
   have been awarded to Chinese companies; whereas China is using some of its industrial
   standards in BRI-related projects in a discriminatory way; whereas BRI-related projects
   must not be awarded in a non-transparent tender; whereas within the BRI, China is using a
   multiplicity of channels; whereas 27 national EU ambassadors to Beijing have recently
   compiled a report that sharply criticises the BRI project, denouncing it as being designed
   to hamper free trade and put Chinese companies at an advantage; whereas BRI is
   regrettably devoid of any kind of human rights safeguards;

G. whereas China’s diplomacy has increasingly emerged as a stronger player from the 19th
   Party Congress and this year’s National People’s Congress (NPC), with at least five high-
   ranking officials in charge of the country’s foreign policy and a substantial boost to the
   budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; whereas a newly created State International
   Development Cooperation Agency will be in charge of coordinating China’s growing
   budget for foreign aid;

H. whereas China introduced limits on terms of office in the 1980s in response to the
   excesses of the Cultural Revolution; whereas on 11 March 2018 the NPC voted almost
   unanimously in favour of abrogating the limit of two consecutive terms for the posts of
   President and Vice-President of the People’s Republic of China;

I. whereas the Chinese top leadership, while claiming non-interference in other countries’
   internal affairs, regularly calls into question Western countries’ political system in its
   official communications;

J. whereas on 11 March 2018, the NPC endorsed the establishment of a National
   Supervisory Commission, a new party-controlled body designed to institutionalise and
   expand control over all civil servants in China, listing it as a state body within China’s
   Constitution;

K. whereas in 2014, the State Council of China announced detailed plans to create a Social
   Credit System with the aim of rewarding behaviour that the Party considers financially,
   economically and socio-politically responsible, while sanctioning non-compliance with its
   policies; whereas the project of social credit scoring will likely also have an impact on
   foreigners living and working in China, including EU citizens, and entail consequences
   for EU and other foreign companies operating in the country;

L. whereas it is clear that in some regions of China, the livelihoods of the rural population
   will deteriorate because of variations in temperature and precipitation and through other
   climate extremes; whereas relocation planning has become an effective adaptation policy
   option to reduce climate-induced vulnerability and poverty1;

M. whereas the human rights situation in China has continued to deteriorate with the
   government stepping up its hostility toward peaceful dissent, the freedom of expression
   and religion, and the rule of law; whereas civil society activists and human rights
   defenders are being detained, prosecuted and sentenced on the basis of vague charges such
   as ‘subverting state power’ and ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’, and are often
   detained incommunicado at undisclosed locations, without access to medical care or legal
   representation; whereas detained human rights defenders and activists are sometimes held
   in ‘residential surveillance in a designated location’, a method used to cut off detainees
   from contact, during which torture and ill-treatment are frequently reported; whereas
   China continues to deny free speech and the freedom to inform, and a high number of
   journalists, bloggers and independent voices have been imprisoned; whereas in its
   strategic framework on human rights and democracy, the EU has pledged that human
   rights, democracy, and rule of law will be promoted ‘in all areas of the EU’s external
   actions without exception’ and that the EU will ‘place human rights at the centre of its
   relations with all third countries including strategic partners’; whereas the EU-China
   summits have to be used to bring about concrete results in the field of human rights,
   namely the release of jailed human rights defenders, lawyers and activists;

N. whereas EU diplomats have at times been prevented by the Chinese authorities from
   observing trials or visiting human rights defenders, work that is in line with the EU
   Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders;

1   Y. Zhen, J. Pan, X. Zhang, ‘Relocation as a policy response to climate change
    vulnerability in Northern China’, ISSC and UNESCO 2013, World Social Science Report
    2013, Changing Global Environments, pp. 234-241.

O. whereas China has set up a sprawling state architecture of digital surveillance, ranging
   from predictive policing to the arbitrary collection of biometric data in an environment
   devoid of privacy rights;

P. whereas the Chinese Government has passed a slew of new laws, in particular, the State
   Security Law, passed on 1 July 2015, the Counterterrorism Law, the Cybersecurity Law
   and the Overseas NGO Management Law (ONGO Law), that designate public activism
   and peaceful criticism of the government as state security threats, strengthen the
   censorship, surveillance and control of individuals and social groups and deter individuals
   from campaigning for human rights;

Q. whereas the ONGO Law, which came into force on 1 January 2017, is one of the biggest
   challenges to international NGOs (INGOs) because this law regulates all activities in
   China funded by INGOs and provincial security officers are primarily responsible for
   implementing the ONGO Law;

R. whereas the new regulations on religious affairs that took effect on 1 February 2018 are
   more restrictive towards religious groups and activities and force them to fall more closely
   into line with party policies; whereas the new rules threaten persons associated with
   religious communities that do not have legal status in the country with the imposition of
   fines when they travel abroad for the purpose of religious education, in the broad sense,
   and even more so for pilgrimages, which are subject to fines amounting to a multiple of
   the lowest salary; whereas freedom of religion and conscience has reached a new low
   since the start of the economic reforms and the opening up of China in the late 1970s;
   whereas religious communities have been facing increasing repression in China, with
   Christians, both in underground and state-sanctioned churches, being targeted through the
   harassment and detention of believers, the demolition of churches and the crackdown on
   Christian gatherings;

S. whereas the situation in Xinjiang, where 10 million Muslim Uighurs and ethnic Kazakhs
   live, has rapidly deteriorated, in particular since President Xi’s ascension to power, as
   absolute control of Xinjiang has been elevated to a top priority, driven by both periodic
   terrorist attacks in or allegedly connected to Xinjiang by Uighurs and the strategic location
   of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region for the BRI; whereas an extrajudicial
   detention programme has been established, holding tens of thousands of people who are
   forced to undergo political ‘re-education’, as well as the development of a sophisticated
   network of invasive digital surveillance, including facial recognition technology and data
   collection, mass deployment of police, and strict restrictions on religious practices and the
   Uighur language and customs;

T. whereas the situation in Tibet has deteriorated over the past few years, in spite of
   economic growth and infrastructure development, with the Chinese Government curtailing
   a wide range of human rights under the pretext of security and stability, and engaging in
   relentless attacks against Tibetan identity and culture; whereas the surveillance and
   control measures have been on the increase over the past few years as well as arbitrary
   detentions, acts of torture and ill-treatment; whereas the Chinese Government has created
   in Tibet an environment in which there are no limits to state authority, a climate of fear is
   pervasive, and every aspect of public and private life is tightly controlled and regulated;
   whereas in Tibet, any acts of non-violent dissent or criticism of state policies with regard
   to ethnic or religious minorities can be considered as ‘splittist’ and therefore criminalised;
   whereas access to the Tibet Autonomous Region today is more restricted than ever for

   foreigners, including EU citizens, particularly for journalists, diplomats and other
   independent observers, and even more difficult for EU citizens of a Tibetan background;
   whereas no progress has been made in the resolution of the Tibetan crisis in the last few
   years as the last round of peace talks took place in 2010; whereas the deterioration of the
   humanitarian situation in Tibet has led to an increase of self-immolation cases with a total
   number of 156 since 2009;

U. whereas the People’s Republic of China (PRC) State Council issued a white paper on the
   practice of the ‘one country, two systems’ policy in Hong Kong on 10 June 2014,
   stressing that the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is
   ultimately subject to the central PRC Government’s authorisation; whereas over the years
   the people of Hong Kong have witnessed mass demonstrations in favour of democracy,
   media freedom and the full implementation of the Basic Law; whereas Hong Kong’s
   traditional open society has paved the way for the development of a genuine and
   independent civil society that actively and constructively takes part in the public life of the
   SAR;

V. whereas the contrasting political developments of the PRC and Taiwan, with an
   increasingly authoritarian and nationalist party-state regime on one side and a multi-party
   democracy on the other, raises the danger of an escalation of the cross-strait relations;
   whereas the EU adheres to the ‘one China’ policy as regards Taiwan, and supports the
   ‘one country, two systems’ principle as regards Hong Kong;

W. whereas after over three years of talks, China and the Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations (ASEAN) agreed in August 2017 on a one-page framework as a basis for future
   discussions on a Code of Conduct (CoC) for all parties in the South China Sea; whereas
   the disputed Chinese land reclamation has largely been completed in the Spratly Islands,
   but continued last year in the Paracel Islands further north;

X. whereas China too is becoming a more active and important external player in the Middle
   East due to its obvious economic, security and geopolitical interests;

Y. whereas China is increasingly providing Official Development Aid (ODA) and is
   emerging as a major actor in development policy, providing a much-needed boost to
   development policy but at the same time raising concerns about local ownership of
   projects;

Z. whereas China’s presence and investments in Africa have been greatly increasing and this
   has led to an exploitation of natural resources often without any consultation of local
   populations;

1. Reasserts that the EU-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership is one of the most
   important partnerships for the EU and that there is still much more potential for deepening
   this relationship and for further cooperation in the international arena; stresses the
   importance of strengthening cooperation and coordination in the field of global
   governance and international institutions, notably at UN and G20 level; stresses that in the
   context of a complex, globalised and multipolar world where China has become a
   significant economic and political actor, the EU has to maintain opportunities for a
   constructive dialogue and cooperation and to promote all necessary reforms in areas of
   common interest; reminds China of its international obligations and responsibilities in

   terms of contributing to peace and global security, as a permanent member of the UN
   Security Council;

2. Recalls that the EU-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership is founded on a shared
   commitment to openness and working together as part of a rules-based international
   system; stresses that both sides have committed to establishing a transparent, just and
   equitable system of global governance, sharing the responsibility for promoting peace,
   prosperity and sustainable development; recalls that the EU’s engagement with China
   should be principled, practical and pragmatic, staying true to its interests and values; is
   concerned that the increase in China’s global economic and political weight over the past
   decade has put the shared commitments at the core of EU-China relations to the test;
   underlines China's responsibilities as a global power and calls on the authorities to ensure
   in all circumstances respect for international law, democracy, human rights and
   fundamental freedoms, in accordance with the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration
   on Human Rights and other international instruments signed or ratified by China; calls on
   the Council, the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Commission to ensure
   that EU-China cooperation is grounded in the rule of law, universality of human rights,
   the international human rights commitments undertaken by both sides and the
   commitment to progress towards the achievement of the highest standard of human rights
   protection; stresses that reciprocity, a level playing field and fair competition across all
   areas of cooperation should be strengthened;

3. Stresses that addressing global and regional challenges, such as security, disarmament,
   non-proliferation, counter-terrorism and cyberspace, cooperation on peace, climate
   change, energy, oceans and resource efficiency, deforestation, wildlife trafficking,
   migration, global health, development and combatting the destruction of cultural heritage
   sites and the looting and trafficking of illegal antiquities all require genuine partnership
   between the EU and China; urges that the EU capitalise on China’s commitment to
   tackling global problems such as climate change and further extend successful cooperation
   in peacekeeping with China, as one of the biggest contributors to the UN budget and an
   increasing contributor of troops to UN peacekeeping operations, to other areas of joint
   interest while promoting multilateralism and a global governance based on respect for
   international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law; welcomes in
   this regard the successful counter-piracy cooperation since 2011 in the Gulf of Aden; calls
   on the EU and its Member States to proactively promote the EU’s economic and political
   interests and to defend EU values and principles; stresses that multilateralism is one of the
   core EU values with regard to global governance and that it must be actively safeguarded
   when dealing with China;

4. Notes that the High Representative's and the Commission's Joint Communication
   ‘Elements for a new EU Strategy on China’, together with the Council conclusions of 18
   July 2016, provide the policy framework for EU engagement with China over the coming
   years;

5. Underlines that the Council has concluded that in conducting their relations with China,
   Member States, the High Representative and the Commission will cooperate to ensure
   consistency with EU law, rules and policies, and that the overall outcome is beneficial for
   the EU as a whole;

6. Recalls that as it continues to grow and integrate into the global economy through its
   ‘going out’ policy as announced in 2001, China seeks to increase its access to the

   European market for Chinese goods and services and to technology and know-how in
   order to support plans such as ‘Made in China 2025’, and to strengthen its political and
   diplomatic influence in Europe; stresses that these ambitions have intensified in particular
   in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, shaping new dynamics in EU-China
   relations;

7. Calls on those Member States participating in the 16+1 format to ensure that their
   participation in this format enables the EU to have one voice in its relationship with
   China; calls on those Member States to carry out sound analysis and scrutiny of suggested
   infrastructure projects involving all the stakeholders and to ensure no compromising of
   national and European interests for short-term financial support and long- term
   commitments to Chinese involvement in strategic infrastructure projects and potentially
   greater political influence, which would undermine the EU’s common positions on China;
   is aware of China's increasing influence on the infrastructure and markets of the EU
   candidate countries; underlines the necessity of transparency of the format by inviting the
   EU institutions to its meetings and keeping them fully briefed on its activities in order to
   ensure that relevant aspects are coherent with EU policy and legislation and give all sides
   mutual benefits and opportunities;

8. Notes the Chinese interest in strategic infrastructure investments in Europe; concludes that
   the Chinese Government is using the BRI as a very effective narrative framework for
   elements of its foreign policy and that EU public diplomacy efforts need to be
   strengthened in the light of this development; supports the call on China to adhere to the
   principles of transparency in public procurement as well as environmental and social
   standards; calls on all EU Member States to support EU public diplomacy responses;
   suggests that data on all Chinese infrastructure investments in EU Member States and
   countries in process of EU accession negotiations be shared with the EU institutions and
   other Member States; recalls that such investments are part of an overall strategy to have
   Chinese state-controlled or state-funded companies take control of banking and the energy
   sector, as well as other supply chains; underlines six overarching challenges of the BRI: a
   multilateral approach to BRI governance; very little local labour employed, receiving
   country and third-country contractor involvement extremely limited (about 86 percent of
   BRI projects involve Chinese contractors), construction materials and equipment imported
   from China, lack of transparency on tenders, and the potential use of Chinese standards
   instead of international standards; insists that the BRI must include human rights
   safeguards, and believes that it is of the utmost importance to develop synergies and
   projects in full transparency and with the involvement of all the stakeholders and in line
   with EU legislation, while complementing EU policies and projects in order to deliver
   benefits for all countries along the planned routes; welcomes the setting-up of the EU-
   China Connectivity Platform, which promotes cooperation in transport infrastructure
   across the Eurasian continent; notes with satisfaction that several infrastructure projects
   have been identified, and underlines that projects should be implemented on the basis of
   key principles such as promotion of economically, socially and environmentally
   sustainable projects, geographic balance, and a level playing field among investors and
   project promoters, as well as transparency;

9. Takes positive note that the EU policy on China forms part of a rounded policy approach
   to the Asia-Pacific region, taking full advantage and account of the EU's close relations
   with partners such as the United States, Japan, South Korea, the ASEAN countries,
   Australia and New Zealand;

10. Stresses that EU-China cooperation should be more people-oriented and deliver more real
    benefits to citizens in order to build mutual trust and understanding; calls on the EU and
    China to live up to the promises made on the occasion of the 4th EU-China High Level
    People-to-People Dialogue in 2017, and to promote more interactions among people, for
    instance by intensifying cultural cooperation in the field of education, training, youth and
    gender equality and joint initiatives in the field of people-to-people exchange;

11. Draws attention to the need for greater support to students and scholars from China who
    are in Europe, so that they are less vulnerable to being pressured by Chinese authorities to
    surveil one another and to become tools of the Chinese state, as well as the importance of
    looking very carefully at substantial mainland funding to academic institutions across
    Europe;

12. Welcomes the outcome of the 4th EU-China High Level People-to-People Dialogue that
    took place on 13 and14 November 2017 in Shanghai; stresses that the High Level People-
    to-People Dialogue should help build mutual trust and consolidate intercultural
    understanding between EU and China;

13. Welcomes the 2018 EU-China Tourism Year (ECTY); highlights that besides its
    economic significance, it is a fine example of EU cultural diplomacy in the framework of
    the EU-China strategic partnership, as well as a way to develop a better understanding
    between European and Chinese peoples; underlines that the 2018 EU-China Tourism Year
    coincides with the European Year of Cultural Heritage and that an increasing number of
    Chinese tourists highly value the cultural richness of Europe;

14. Calls on the EU Member States to urgently and decisively step up collaboration and unity
    on their China policies, including in the UN fora, in view of the EU’s failure, for the first
    time ever, to make a joint statement on China’s human rights records at the UN Human
    Rights Council in Geneva in June 2017; strongly suggests taking advantage of Europe’s
    much greater collective bargaining power with China, and that Europe defends its
    democracies so as to better face up to China’s systematic efforts to influence its politicians
    and civil society, in order to shape an opinion more conducive to China’s strategic
    interests; in that regard calls on the larger Member States to use their political and
    economic weight towards China to promote the EU’s interests; is concerned that China is
    also attempting to influence educational and academic institutions and their curricula;
    proposes that the EU and the Member States foster high-quality European thinktanks on
    China in order to ensure the availability of independent expert advice for strategic
    orientations and decision-making;

15. Underlines that the promotion of human rights and the rule of law must be at the core of
    the EU's engagement with China; firmly condemns the ongoing harassment, arbitrary
    arrest and prosecution of human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists, bloggers,
    academics and labour rights defenders and their families without due process, including
    foreign nationals both in mainland China and abroad; underlines that a vibrant civil
    society and the work of human rights defenders are key to an open and prosperous society;
    stresses the importance for the EU to robustly act to promote full respect for human rights
    in the context of its relationship with China, focusing on both immediate results such as to
    end the government’s crackdown on human rights defenders, civil society actors and
    dissidents, to end all judicial harassment and intimidation against them, to immediately
    and unconditionally release all political prisoners, including EU citizens and
    medium/long-term goals such as legal and policy reforms in line with international human

   rights law. and to develop, implement and continue to adapt a strategy to maintain
   visibility of EU action on human rights in China, including a strategy on public
   communications; insists that EU and Member State diplomats must not be prevented or
   obstructed from implementing the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders; commits
   that the EU must prioritise providing protection and support for human rights defenders at
   risk;

16. Calls on the EU and its Member States to pursue a more ambitious, united and transparent
    policy with regard to human rights in China and to substantially consult and engage with
    civil society, in particular ahead of high-level meetings and human rights dialogues;
    underlines that the EU at the 35th round of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue
    emphasised the deteriorating situation for civil and political rights in China, including
    restrictions on freedom of expression; calls on China to act upon the issues raised at the
    Human Rights Dialogue, to fulfil its international obligations and to respect its own
    constitutional safeguards for upholding the rule of law; insists on maintaining a regular,
    high-level and results-oriented human rights dialogue; is concerned that the evaluation of
    human rights dialogues with China have never been public and has never been open to
    independent groups from China; calls on the EU to set clear benchmarks for progress, to
    ensure more transparency and to involve independent Chinese voices in the discussion;
    calls on the EU and its Member States to disclose, collect and address all forms of visa
    harassment (delayed or denied visa issuance/access with no reasons given and pressure
    applied by Chinese authorities during the application process in forms of ‘interviews’ with
    Chinese interlocutors unwilling to identify themselves) regarding scholars, journalists or
    members of civil society organisations;

17. Is seriously worried about the findings of the FCCC’s 2017 report that the Chinese
    Government has intensified its attempts to deny or restrict the access of foreign journalists
    to large parts of the country while increasing the use of the visa renewal process to
    pressure unwanted correspondents and news organisations; urges the EU and its Member
    States to demand from the Chinese authorities reciprocity in press freedom, and warns
    against the pressure foreign correspondents are experiencing at home as Chinese
    diplomats reach out to media headquarters to criticise the work of reporters in the field;

18. Notes that the PRC is the EU’s second-largest trading partner and that the EU is the
    PRC’s largest trading partner; stresses the constant growth in trade between the two but
    considers the balance of trade in goods to be skewed in the PRC’s favour; calls for a
    cooperative approach and a constructive attitude in order to effectively address matters of
    concern and exploit the great potential of EU-PRC trade; calls on the Commission to
    intensify cooperation and dialogue with the PRC;

19. Notes the findings of recent investigations that since 2008, China has acquired assets in
    Europe worth USD 318 billion; notes that this figure does not include several mergers,
    investments and joint ventures;

20. Notes that the PRC is a major global trade player and that the country’s large market
    could in principle represent, particularly in the current global trade context, a good
    opportunity for the EU and for European businesses; recalls that Chinese companies,
    including state-owned enterprises, are benefiting from wide open markets in the EU;
    acknowledges the remarkable results of the PRC in lifting hundreds of millions of citizens
    out of poverty over the past four decades;

21. Notes that EU outward foreign direct investment (FDI) in the PRC has steadily decreased
    since 2012, particularly in the traditional manufacturing sector, with a parallel increase in
    investment in high-tech services, utilities, and agricultural and construction services, while
    the PRC’s investment in the EU has grown exponentially over the past few years;
    acknowledges that since 2016 the PRC has become a net investor in the EU; takes note of
    the fact that in 2017, 68 % of Chinese investments into Europe came from state-owned
    enterprises; is concerned about state-orchestrated acquisitions that might hinder European
    strategic interests, public security objectives, competitiveness and employment;

22. Welcomes the Commission’s proposal on an FDI screening mechanism in the areas of
    security and public order, which represents one of the EU’s endeavours to adapt to a
    changing global environment, without specifically targeting any one of the EU’s
    international trade partners; cautions that the mechanism should not lead to protectionism
    in disguise; calls, nonetheless, for its swift adoption;

23. Welcomes the commitments made by President Xi Jinping to further open up the Chinese
    market to foreign investors and improve the investment environment, to complete the
    revision of the negative list on foreign investment and lift restrictions for European
    companies, and to strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights and level the
    playing field by making the PRC’s market more transparent and better regulated; calls for
    the fulfilment of these commitments;

24. Reiterates the importance of ceasing all discriminatory practices against foreign investors;
    recalls, in this respect, that such reforms will benefit both Chinese and European
    businesses, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs);

25. Calls on the Commission to promote the Union’s new General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR) as a gold standard in its trade relations with China; points out the need for a
    systematic dialogue with China and other WTO partners on regulatory requirements
    relating to the digitisation of our economies and its multifaceted impact on: trade,
    production chains, cross-border digital services, 3D printing, consumption patterns,
    payments, taxes, the protection of personal data, property rights issues, the provision and
    protection of audiovisual services, the media and people-to-people contacts;

26. Calls on the PRC to accelerate the process of joining the WTO Government Procurement
    Agreement and to submit an accession offer so as to give European companies access to
    its market on an equivalent basis to the access that Chinese companies already enjoy in the
    EU; regrets the fact that the Chinese public procurement market remains largely closed to
    foreign suppliers, with European businesses suffering from discrimination and a lack of
    access to the Chinese market; calls on the PRC to allow non-discriminatory access to
    European businesses and workers on public procurement; calls on the Council to swiftly
    adopt the International Procurement Instrument; calls on the Commission to be vigilant
    against contracts awarded to foreign enterprises suspected of dumping practices and to
    take action where necessary;

27. Calls for coordinated cooperation with the PRC on the Belt and Road Initiative on the
    basis of reciprocity, sustainable development, good governance, and open and transparent
    rules, in particular as regards public procurement; regrets, in this respect, the fact that the
    Memorandum of Understanding signed by the European Investment Fund and the PRC’s
    Silk Road Fund (SRF) and that signed by the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Asian
    Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the European Bank for

   Reconstruction and Development, the New Development Bank and the World Bank have
   not yet improved the business environment for European enterprises and workers; regrets
   the absence of professional sustainable impact assessments in various projects relating to
   Belt and Road, and underlines the importance of investment quality, particularly with
   regard to positive effects on employment, labour rights, environmentally sound
   production, and the mitigation of climate change, in line with multilateral governance and
   international standards;

28. Supports the ongoing negotiations on a comprehensive EU-PRC Investment Agreement,
    which were launched in 2013, and invites the PRC to engage more in this process; calls on
    both parties to renew their efforts to advance the negotiations, which are aimed at
    achieving a genuine level playing field for European businesses and workers, and to
    ensure reciprocity in market access, striving for specific provisions on SMEs and public
    procurement; calls on both parties, moreover, to seize the opportunity provided by the
    investment agreement to increase their cooperation in the area of environmental and
    labour rights, and to include a sustainable development chapter in the text;

29. Recalls that EU companies face a growing number of restrictive market access measures
    in the PRC owing to joint venture obligations in several sectors of industry and further
    discriminatory technical requirements, including forced data localisation and source code
    disclosure, and regulatory rules for foreign-owned business; welcomes, in this regard, the
    Notice on Several Measures on Promoting Further Openness and Active Utilisation of
    Foreign Investment, issued by the PRC’s State Council in 2017, but regrets the absence of
    a timeline for achieving its goals; calls on the Chinese authorities, therefore, to swiftly
    materialise these commitments;

30. Calls for both the EU and its Member States and China to intensify cooperation to build
    up circular economies, as this urgent need has become even more visible following
    China’s legitimate decision to ban imports of plastic waste from Europe; calls on both
    partners to intensify economic and technological cooperation in order to prevent global
    production chains, trade and transport, and tourism services from causing an unacceptable
    build-up of plastic pollution in our oceans;

31. Calls on the PRC to strive to play a responsible role on the global stage, with complete
    cognisance of the responsibilities arising from its economic presence and performance in
    third countries and on global markets, including by lending its active support to the
    multilateral rules-based trading system and the WTO; believes, in the present context of
    global value chains, that heightening international trade tensions should be resolved
    through negotiations, while reiterating the need to pursue multilateral solutions; calls, in
    this respect, for the fulfilment of obligations enshrined in the PRC’s Accession Protocol to
    the WTO and the protection of its operative mechanisms; underlines the notification and
    transparency obligations stemming from WTO agreements as regards subsidies, and
    expresses concerns about the current practice of the direct or indirect subsidisation of
    Chinese companies; calls for coordination with major EU trading partners on joint efforts
    and action to tackle and eliminate state-induced market distortions affecting global trade;

32. Regrets the fact that the PRC, despite the completion of the procedure for reforming the
    European anti-dumping duties calculation methodology, has not yet withdrawn its case
    against the EU at the WTO appellate body;

33. Expresses concern at the escalating tariff measures being taken by China and the United
    States;

34. Expresses concern at the number of restrictions that European companies, and MSMEs in
    particular, continue to face in the PRC, including the 2017 Foreign Investment Catalogue
    and the 2017 Free Trade Zone Negative List, as well as in sectors covered by the ‘Made in
    China 2025’ plan; calls for the rapid reduction of these restrictions in order to fully
    harness the potential of cooperation and synergies between Industry 4.0 schemes in
    Europe and the ‘Made in China 2025’ strategy, in view of the need to restructure our
    production sectors towards intelligent manufacturing, including cooperation in the
    development and definition of respective industrial standards in multilateral fora; recalls
    the importance of reducing government subsidies in the PRC;

35. Calls on the PRC to stop making market access increasingly conditional on forced
    technology transfers, as stated in the European Union Chamber of Commerce’s 2017
    position paper on China;

36. Calls for the resumption of negotiations on the Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA),
    by building on the fruitful collaboration between the EU and the PRC in the fight against
    climate change and the strong joint commitment towards the implementation of the Paris
    Agreement; stresses the trade potential of technological cooperation on clean
    technologies;

37. Notes with concern the conclusions of the Commission’s report on the protection and
    enforcement of intellectual property rights in third countries, which singles out the PRC as
    the chief concern; reiterates the need to ensure protection for the European knowledge-
    based economy; calls on the PRC to fight the illicit use of European licences by Chinese
    companies;

38. Calls on the Commission to provide for a European Union presence at the China
    International Import Expo to be held in Shanghai in November 2018, and to provide
    SMEs, in particular, with the opportunity to showcase their work; calls on the
    Commission to reach out to chambers of commerce, particularly in Member States that are
    currently less involved in trade with China, in order to promote this opportunity;

39. Expresses concern about the PRC’s state measures that caused trade distortions, including
    industrial overcapacity in raw material sectors such as the steel and aluminium sectors,
    among others; recalls the commitments made at the first ministerial meeting of the Global
    Forum on Steel Excess Capacity in 2017 to refrain from providing market-distorting
    subsidies, but regrets the failure of the Chinese delegation to deliver data on capacity;
    calls on the PRC to fulfil its commitment to identify and disclose data on its subsidies and
    support measures for the steel and aluminium industries; recognises the link between
    global industrial overcapacity and the surge in protectionist trade measures, and continues
    to urge multilateral cooperation in order to address the structural concerns behind
    overcapacity; welcomes the proposed tripartite action by the US, Japan and the EU at
    WTO level;

40. Highlights the importance of an ambitious EU-PRC agreement on geographical
    indications (GIs), based on the highest international standards, and welcomes the EU-PRC
    2017 joint announcement on the list of 200 Chinese and European GIs, for which
    protection will be the subject of negotiations; considers, however, that given that

   negotiations were launched in 2010, the list is a very modest outcome, and regrets the lack
   of progress in this regard; calls for an early conclusion of negotiations and urges both
   parties to consider the opportunity of the upcoming EU-PRC Summit as a good occasion
   to score effective progress to this end; reiterates the need to cooperate further in the field
   of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures in order to reduce burdens on EU exporters;

41. Welcomes China’s decision to delay by one year the implementation of new certifications
    for imported food and drink, which would have dramatically reduced food imports from
    the EU; welcomes, moreover, the delay in implementation of new standards for electric
    vehicles and calls for substantive dialogue and increased coordination regarding such
    initiatives;

42. Recommends that the EU and the Chinese Government launch a joint initiative within the
    G20 to establish a Global Forum on Aluminium Excess Capacity, with a mandate to
    address the entire value chain of the bauxite, alumina and aluminium industry, including
    raw material prices and environmental aspects;

43. Calls on the Commission to actively monitor the Chinese trade distortion measures, which
    are affecting EU companies’ positions in global markets, and to take appropriate action in
    the WTO and other fora, including through dispute settlement;

44. Notes that a new Chinese foreign investment law is in the process of being drafted; urges
    the Chinese parties concerned to strive for transparency, accountability, predictability and
    legal certainty, and to take into account the proposals and expectations of the current EU-
    China dialogue on the trade and investment relationship;

45. Express concerns about the new cybersecurity law, which includes, inter alia, new
    regulatory barriers for foreign companies that sell telecommunications and IT equipment
    and services; regrets the fact that such recently adopted measures, together with the
    establishment of Chinese Communist Party groups within private companies, including
    foreign firms, and measures such as the NGO law, make the overall business environment
    in the PRC more hostile for foreign and private economic operators;

46. Notes that in 2016 the PRC’s banking system surpassed that of the euro area as the
    world’s largest; calls on the PRC to allow foreign banking enterprises to compete on an
    equal footing with domestic institutions and to cooperate with the EU in the area of
    financial regulation; welcomes the PRC’s decision to reduce tariffs on 187 consumer
    goods and the removal of foreign ownership caps for banks;

47. Recalls its 2015 report on relations between the EU and the PRC, in which it called for the
    launch of negotiations for a bilateral investment agreement with Taiwan; points out that
    the Commission has on more than one occasion announced the launch of negotiations on
    investment with Hong Kong and Taiwan, but deems it regrettable that no such
    negotiations have actually begun; reiterates its support for a bilateral investment
    agreement with Taiwan and Hong Kong; recognises that both partners could also act as a
    springboard to mainland China for EU businesses;

48. Calls on the Commission to coordinate with the Member States and under the consultation
    of Parliament to formulate a unified European position and common economic strategy
    towards the PRC; calls on all Member States to consistently adhere to this strategy;

49. Underlines the potential consequences of the proposed social credit system for the
    business environment, and calls for its implementation in a transparent, fair and equitable
    manner;

50. Welcomes the legislative progress in the EU on Regulation (EU) 2017/821 on supply
    chain due diligence obligations for Union importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their
    ores, and gold originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas, and similar conflict
    minerals legislation in China aimed at ensuring that the trade in these minerals does not
    finance armed conflict; emphasises the need to prevent conflict minerals from being
    processed in our mobile phones, cars and jewellery; calls on both the Commission and the
    Chinese Government to set up structured cooperation to support the implementation of the
    new legislation and to effectively prevent global, Chinese and EU smelters and refiners
    from using conflict minerals, to protect mine workers, including children, from being
    abused, and to require EU and Chinese companies to ensure that they import these
    minerals and metals from responsible sources only;

51. Notes that at the 19th Party Congress held in October 2017 and during the last session of
    the NPC, General Secretary and President Xi Jinping strengthened his position of power
    within the party, paving the way for the unlimited extension of his mandate, and increased
    the control of the party organs over the state apparatus and the economy, including the
    setting up of party cells in foreign enterprises; notes that the corresponding overhaul of the
    political system of the PRC is accompanied by a further shift in political focus towards a
    policy based on close surveillance in all areas;

52. Stresses that the creation of the National Supervisory Commission, whose legal status is
    equal to that of the courts and the public prosecutor, is a drastic step towards merging
    party and state functions, as it establishes a State supervisory body that takes its orders
    from and shares offices and staff with the Party’s Central Commission for Discipline
    Inspection (CCDI); is concerned about the far-ranging personal consequences of this
    extension of the party supervision to a large number of people, as it means that the anti-
    corruption campaign can be expanded to prosecute not just party members but also civil
    servants, from managers of state-owned companies to university professors and directors
    of village schools;

53. Observes that while the Social Credit System is still under construction, blacklists of non-
    compliant individuals and legal entities, as well as ‘red lists’ for outstanding individuals
    and companies, form the core of the current stage of implementation, whereby the main
    focus is on punishing offenders on the blacklists and rewarding those on the red lists;
    notes that in early 2017 China's Supreme People's Court stated that more than six million
    Chinese nationals had been banned from flying as a result of social misdeeds; firmly
    rejects the public naming and shaming of blacklisted persons as an integral part of the
    Social Credit System; underlines the importance and necessity of a dialogue between the
    EU institutions and their Chinese counterparts on all serious societal consequences of the
    present central planning and local experiments with the Social Credit System;

54. Expresses concern at China’s massive cyberspace surveillance systems and calls for the
    adoption of a regulation on enforceable privacy rights; condemns the ongoing crackdown
    on internet freedom by the Chinese authorities, in particular the freedom to access foreign
    websites, and regrets the policy of self-censorship adopted by some Western companies
    operating in China; recalls that eight out of the world's 25 most popular websites are
    blocked in China, including websites from major IT firms;

55. Remarks that Xi’s declaration about the vital importance of ‘long-term stability’ in
    Xinjiang to the success of BRI has resulted in the intensification of longstanding strategies
    of control augmented by a variety of technological innovations and a rapid increase in
    expenditure on domestic security, and the use of counter-terrorism measures to criminalise
    dissent and dissident individuals via the application of a broad definition of terrorism; is
    concerned by the state’s implementation of measures to ensure the ‘comprehensive
    supervision’ of the region via installation of China’s ‘Skynet’ electronic surveillance in
    major urban areas, installations of GPS trackers in all motor vehicles, use of facial
    recognition scanners at checkpoints and at train and petrol stations, and a blood-collecting
    effort by Xinjiang’s police to further expand China’s DNA database; expresses its deepest
    concern at the sending of thousands of Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs to political ‘re-
    education camps’ based on analysis of the data harvested through a system of ‘predictive
    policing’, including for having travelled abroad or being adjudged to be too religiously
    devout; judges that Xi’s proclamation that BRI will ‘benefit people across the whole
    world’ as it will be based on the ‘Silk Road spirit’ of ‘peace and cooperation, openness
    and inclusiveness’ is far removed from the reality confronting Uyghurs and ethnic
    Kazakhs in Xinjiang; urges the Chinese authorities to free those reportedly detained for
    their beliefs or cultural practices and identities;

56. Stresses that the institutional and financial strengthening of China’s diplomacy reflects the
    high priority given by Xi Jinping to foreign policy as part of his vision to turn China into a
    global power by 2049; notes that the shifting of responsibility for foreign affairs, made
    during the last session of the NPC, proves the growing role of foreign policy in the Party's
    decision-making process; underlines the fact that the establishment of the State
    International Development Cooperation Agency expresses the great importance that Xi’s
    leadership attaches to bolstering its global security interests through economic means, for
    example by ‘better serving’ BRI; concludes, therefore, that over the next five years China
    will be more present and more engaged overseas, with diplomatic and economic initiatives
    to which the EU and its Member States must find common answers and strategies;

57. Stresses the importance of ensuring peace and security in the South and East China Seas
    for stability in the region; underlines the importance of ensuring freedom and safety of
    navigation in the region for many Asian and European states; notes that structures
    completed over the last year on land features in both the Spratlys and Paracels in the
    South China Sea include large hangars along 3 km-long airstrips, hardened shelters for
    missile platforms, large underground storage areas, many administrative buildings,
    military jamming equipment, large networks of high frequency and over-the-horizon radar
    and sensor arrays, and that this points to a phase of consolidation and further build-up of
    far-reaching surveillance and military capabilities, while further militarisation of the
    islands through placement of even more advanced military platforms might be reserved as
    potential retaliation to fresh legal actions or expanded international naval presence; calls
    on China and ASEAN to speed up consultations on a Code of Conduct for the peaceful
    resolution of disputes and controversies in this area; insists that the issue should be solved
    according to international law under the United Nations Convention on the Law Of the
    Sea (UNCLOS); underlines that the EU and its Member States, as contracting parties to
    UNCLOS), acknowledge the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal; reiterates its call on
    China to accept the Tribunal’s award; underlines that the EU would like to maintain the
    international order based upon the rule of law;

58. Is strongly concerned about the shrinking space for civil society since Xi Jinping rose to
    power in 2012, especially in view of the Overseas NGO Management Law which entered

   into force on 1 January 2017, putting all foreign NGOs, including thinktanks and
   academic institutions, under an increased administrative burden and economic pressure
   and under the strict control of a Supervisory Unit affiliated with the Ministry of Public
   Security, with a strongly negative impact on their operations and funding; expects that
   European NGOs enjoy in China the same liberties that China's NGOs enjoy in the EU;
   calls on the Chinese authorities to repeal restrictive legislation such as the Overseas NGO
   Law, which is inconsistent with the right to freedom of association, opinion and
   expression;

59. Insists that the Chinese authorities must guarantee that all those in detention must be
    treated in accordance with international norms and provided with access to legal counsel
    and medical treatment, in line with the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All
    Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment;

60. Encourages China, as the 20th anniversary of its signature to the International Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights approaches, to ratify it and to ensure its full implementation,
    including by ending all abusive practices and adapting its legislation as necessary;

61. Condemns the use of the death penalty, recalling that China has executed more people
    than all other countries combined and in 2016 the country carried out about 2 000 death
    sentences; urges China to shed light on the scale of executions in the country and to
    ensure judicial transparency; calls for the EU to increase its diplomatic efforts and demand
    respect for human rights and the abolition of the death penalty;

62. Is strongly concerned that the main content of the new religious regulations will result in
    all religions and non-religious ethical associations, whether authorised or unauthorised,
    being given certain labels by the Chinese Government; underlines the fact that there are
    many congregations of the house churches in China who refuse to join the party- and
    state-sanctioned Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee and the Christian Council for
    theological reasons; calls on the Chinese Government to allow the many house churches
    which are willing to register to do so directly with the government’s Department of Civil
    Affairs, so that their rights and interests as social organisations will be protected;

63. Urges China to review its policies in Tibet; calls on China to review and amend the laws,
    regulations and measures passed in recent years that severely limit the exercise of civil
    and political rights of Tibetans, including their freedom of expression and their religious
    freedom; urges the Chinese leadership to pursue development and environmental policies
    that respect the economic, social and cultural rights of Tibetans and are inclusive of local
    populations, in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; calls on the
    Chinese government to investigate the ongoing cases of enforced disappearances, torture
    and ill-treatment of Tibetans and to respect their rights to freedom of association, peaceful
    assembly and freedom of religion and belief, in line with international human rights
    standards; stresses that the degradation of human rights in Tibet must be systematically
    raised at each EU-China Summit; calls for the resumption of a constructive and peaceful
    dialogue between the Chinese authorities and representatives of the Tibetan people; urges
    China to give EU diplomats, journalists and citizens unfettered access to Tibet in
    reciprocity to the free and open access to the entire territories of the EU Member States
    that Chinese travellers enjoy; calls on the Chinese authorities to allow Tibetans in Tibet to
    travel freely and to respect their right to freedom of movement; urges the Chinese
    authorities to allow independent observers, including the United Nations High
    Commissioner for Human Rights, to access Tibet; urges the EU institutions to take the

   issue of access to Tibet into serious consideration in the discussions on the EU-China visa
   facilitation agreement;

64. Notes that the Annual Report 2017 on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
    (SAR) by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy
    and the European Commission concludes that despite some challenges, overall the ‘one
    country, two systems’ principle worked well, that the rule of law prevailed and free
    speech and freedom of information are generally respected, but that this report also voices
    concerns about the gradual erosion of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle, giving rise
    to legitimate questions about its implementation and Hong Kong’s high degree of
    autonomy in the long term; underlines that the Annual Report observes that two negative
    trends regarding free speech and freedom of information became more pronounced,
    namely self-censorship when reporting on China’s domestic and foreign policy
    developments and pressure on journalists; fully supports the encouragement of the EU to
    the Hong Kong SAR and the Central Government authorities to resume electoral reform in
    line with the Basic Law and to reach agreement on an electoral system that is democratic,
    fair, open and transparent; underlines that the people of Hong Kong have a legitimate right
    to continue to rely on a judiciary which is trusted, the prevalence of the rule of law and
    low levels of corruption, transparency, human rights, freedom of opinion, and high
    standards of public health and safety; underlines that the full respect of Hong Kong's
    autonomy could provide the model for a process of deep democratic political reforms in
    China and the gradual liberalisation and opening of Chinese society;

65. Calls for the EU and its Member States to do their utmost to urge the PRC to refrain from
    further military provocation towards Taiwan and endangering peace and stability in the
    Taiwan Strait; emphasises that all cross-strait disputes should be settled by peaceful
    means on the basis of international law; expresses its concern about the unilateral decision
    by China to start using new flight routes above the Taiwan Strait; encourages the
    resumption of official dialogues between Beijing and Taipei; reiterates its consistent
    support for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in international organisations, such as the
    World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation
    (ICAO), where Taiwan’s continuous exclusion is not in line with the EU’s interests;

66. Recalls that as North Korea’s biggest trade partner and main source of food and energy,
    China continues to play an instrumental role in addressing North Korea’s globally
    threatening provocations together with the international community; welcomes, therefore,
    China’s recent inclination to uphold some of the international sanctions against
    Pyongyang, including suspending coal imports from North Korea and restricting financial
    activities of North Korean individuals and businesses, as well as trade restrictions on
    textiles and seafood; also welcomes Beijing’s efforts to establish dialogue with
    Pyongyang; urges the EU to speak with unity on China in order to play a constructive role
    in supporting the upcoming inter-Korean summit as well as the North Korea-US summit,
    with a view to actively assisting with the verifiable denuclearisation of North Korea and
    the establishment of permanent peace on the Korean peninsula;

67. Commends China for adhering to the sanctions against North Korea; calls on China to
    constructively contribute to the resolving of the situation in the Korean peninsula and to
    continue applying sanctions against North Korea until it has made significant progress in
    giving up its nuclear weapons, changing its rhetoric vis-à-vis South Korea and Japan and
    starting to uphold human rights;

68. Underlines the importance of China’s efforts to achieve peace, security and stability in the
    Korean peninsula;

69. Welcomes China’s contributions to United Nations and African Union peacekeeping;
    remarks that the EU aims to reinforce its engagement with China on foreign policy and
    security issues by encouraging China to mobilise its diplomatic and other resources to
    support international security, and to contribute to peace and security in the EU’s
    neighbourhood based on international law; notes that the cooperation with China in the
    field of export control, disarmament, non-proliferation issues and the denuclearisation of
    the Korean peninsula is essential to ensure stability in the East Asia region;

70. Welcomes China’s aim to develop into a sustainable economy; stresses that the EU can
    support China’s economic reform programme with its know-how; underlines that China is
    a key partner for the EU with regard to tackling climate change and global environmental
    challenges; aims to work together with China to speed up the implementation of the Paris
    Climate Agreement;

71. Welcomes the reforms undertaken by China since the launch of its ‘ecological
    civilisation’ approach; considers the special status granted to environmental NGOs in
    courts, audits of the environmental impact of the work of officials, and high investment in
    electro-mobility and clean energy as reforms in the right direction;

72. Welcomes China’s 2016 action plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance; stresses the
    importance of cooperation between China, which accounts for half the world’s annual
    antimicrobial drug consumption, and the EU in tackling this global threat; insists that
    animal welfare provisions should be included in bilateral EU-China trade agreements;

73. Takes note of China’s decision to ban imports of solid waste, which highlights the
    importance of the process of designing, producing, repairing, reusing and recycling
    products, with a particular emphasis on the production and use of plastic; recalls China’s
    recent attempt to ban exports of rare earth elements, and asks the Commission to take into
    consideration the interdependence of the global economies when prioritising EU policies;

74. Believes that there would be scope, an interest in and a need for the EU and ASEAN to
    work together to develop a joint circular economy strategy; believes China could play a
    key role in taking this initiative forward in ASEAN;

75. Argues that China and the European Union will benefit from promoting sustainability in
    their economies and from developing a multi-sector sustainable and circular bioeconomy;

76. Welcomes the agreement to increase cooperation on research and innovation in flagship
    initiatives such as those on food, agriculture and biotechnologies, environment and
    sustainable urbanisation, surface transport, safer and greener aviation and biotechnologies
    for environment and human health that were agreed upon during the 3rd EU-China
    Innovation Cooperation Dialogue in June 2017 and the corresponding Roadmap for EU-
    China science and technology (S&T) cooperation from October 2017; calls on the EU and
    China to continue these efforts and to put the results of the research and development
    projects into practice;

77. Points out that the EU and China are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and together
    account for around a third of total global consumption, which places China at the top of

   the World Health Organisation (WHO) ranking for deadly outdoor air pollution; stresses
   that increased trade in bioeconomy products made from renewable materials can help
   reduce the fossil dependency of China’s and the Union’s economies; calls for the EU and
   China to deepen their relations in other areas of mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions
   such as electric mobility, renewable energies and energy efficiency, to continue and
   broaden the EU-China Roadmap on energy cooperation beyond 2020, and to intensify
   joint efforts on developing instruments for green finance, especially climate finance; calls
   for China and the EU to explore and engage in the advance planning and development of
   cross-border electricity transmission lines, using high-voltage direct current technology to
   make renewable energy sources more accessible;

78. Encourages the EU and China to continue their partnership on sustainable urbanisation,
    including in areas such as clean transport, air quality improvement, the circular economy
    and ecodesign; stresses the need for further environmental protection measures, bearing in
    mind that more than 90 % of cities do not comply with the national standard of PM 2.5 air
    pollution concentration and that in China more than one million people die each year from
    diseases linked to air pollution;

79. Underlines the mutual interest of the EU and China in promoting low-carbon development
    and addressing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in transparent, public and well-regulated
    energy markets; believes in the value of strategic EU-China partnerships as necessary for
    the implementation of the Paris Agreement and for the effective combating of climate
    change; calls on the EU and China to use their political weight to advance the
    implementation of the Paris Agreement as well as of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable
    Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and urges a cooperative
    approach at the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC as well as at the High-level
    Political Forum of the UN; calls on both sides to adopt a joint statement on climate action
    to demonstrate their shared commitment to a strong implementation of the Paris
    Agreement and active participation in the 2018 Talanoa Dialogue as well as at COP24;
    encourages both sides to play a responsible role in international negotiations by
    contributing to the objective to limit global warming through their respective internal
    climate policies, as well as by making financial contributions to reach the goal of
    providing USD 100 billion annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation;

80. Welcomes the launch of the nationwide emissions trading system in China in December
    2017; takes note of the successful cooperation during the preparation phase between
    China and the EU enabling the launch; recognises the willingness of the Chinese
    leadership to reduce GHG emissions, and looks forward to the results of the ongoing work
    on monitoring, reporting and verification, which is key to the good functioning of the
    system; stresses the importance of economy-wide action on climate change, and welcomes
    the intention to expand its coverage to include industrial sectors and improve the trading
    arrangements of the system; calls on the EU and China to continue their partnership
    within the cooperation project for the development of China’s carbon market, for it to
    become an effective instrument that creates meaningful incentives for emission reduction
    and further aligning it to the EU emissions trading system; calls on both sides to further
    promote carbon pricing mechanisms in other countries and regions, by using their own
    experiences and expertise and by exchanging best practice as well as engaging in efforts
    to build up cooperation between existing carbon markets in order to work towards a global
    level playing field;

81. Hopes that China will uncouple economic growth from ecological degradation, by
    incorporating biodiversity protection into its ongoing global strategies, facilitating the
    achievement of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs, and
    implementing the ivory trade ban effectively; acknowledges the work done by the EU-
    China Bilateral Coordination Mechanism (BCM) on Forest Law Enforcement and
    Governance (FLEG) to tackle illegal logging globally; urges China, however, to
    investigate the significant undocumented trade in timber between the FLEGT Voluntary
    Partnership Agreement signatory states and China;

82. Recommends the adoption of mandatory Chinese policy guidelines on responsible
    overseas forestry investments to be implemented jointly with the supplier countries,
    involving Chinese companies in tackling the illegal timber trade;

83. Welcomes the fact that China and the EU have signed a Memorandum of Understanding
    (MOU) on water policy, with the aim of enhancing dialogue on the development and
    enforcement of legislation to protect water; strongly supports the September 2017 Turku
    Declaration signed by the EU and China, which stressed that good water governance
    should give priority to ecology and green development, to putting water conservation in a
    prominent position and to restoring water ecosystems; underlines that the MOU on
    establishing an EU-China Water Policy Dialogue not only enriches the contents of China-
    EU strategic partnership, but also specifies the direction, scope, methodology and
    financial arrangements for cooperation;

84. Recognises the key role of the Commission-funded cooperation project between European
    and Chinese organisations, implemented in 2014-2017 under the auspices of the
    Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation (INSC), in assessing the standards and
    arrangements for radiological and nuclear emergency management in China and in
    enhancing the capabilities of the Chinese Nuclear Power Technology Research Institute in
    the area of severe accident management guidelines;

85. Encourages Chinese and European investors to adopt better global standards of social and
    environmental responsibility and to improve the safety standards of their extractive
    industries worldwide; reiterates that, with regard to negotiations on a Comprehensive
    Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China, the European Union must lend support to
    sustainable development initiatives by encouraging responsible investment and promoting
    core environmental and labour standards; asks the Chinese and European authorities to put
    in place incentives to encourage Chinese and European mining companies to conduct their
    activities in developing countries in conformity with international human rights standards
    and to encourage investment in capacity-building for knowledge and technology transfer
    and local recruitment;

86. Welcomes the announcement by China in the context of the One Planet Summit in
    December 2017 to make the environmental impacts of companies in China and of Chinese
    investment abroad more transparent; is concerned that infrastructure projects such as the
    One Belt One Road (OBOR) Initiative by China might have a negative impact on the
    environment and climate and could lead to the increased use of fossil fuels in other
    countries involved or affected by the infrastructure development; calls for the EU
    institutions and Member States to perform environmental impact assessments and to
    include sustainability clauses in any cooperation project within the OBOR framework;
    insists on the establishment of a joint committee, composed of representatives of involved
    countries and third parties, to supervise the impact on the environment and climate;

   welcomes the initiative of the Commission and the EEAS to draw up an EU-Asia
   connectivity strategy in the first half of 2018; insists that this strategy should include
   strong commitments to sustainability, environmental protection and climate action;

87. Welcomes China’s progress in enhancing food safety standards, key features in protecting
    Chinese consumers and preventing food fraud; stresses the improvement of consumer
    empowerment as an important step in the rise of a consumer culture in China;

88. Encourages the Chinese and European police and law enforcement services to take
    common action to control the export of illegal drugs and to share intelligence on drug
    trafficking by exchanging information to identify individuals and criminal networks; notes
    that, according to the study entitled ‘European Drug Report 2017: Trends and
    Developments’ published by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
    Addiction (EMCDDA), much of the supply of new psychoactive substances to Europe
    originates in China, with new substances being produced in bulk by chemical and
    pharmaceutical companies in China, from where they are shipped to Europe, where they
    are processed into products, packaged and sold;

89. Acknowledges that families and individuals have migrated in response to drought and
    other natural disasters, and that, in response, the Chinese authorities have planned several
    large-scale relocation projects; is concerned by reports from the Ningxia region pointing
    out numerous problems with the new towns, and reprisals for people who refused to
    move; expresses its concern about the fact that environmental defenders are being
    detained, prosecuted and sentenced and that registered domestic environmental NGOs are
    facing increasing scrutiny by the Chinese supervisory authorities;

90. Asks China to further expand its law enforcement efforts to stop illegal fishing, as Chinese
    fishing boats continue to poach in foreign waters, including Korea’s Western Sea, the East
    China Sea, the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, and even South America;

91. Asks Chinese exporters and European importers to cut toxic residues in Chinese-made
    clothes by establishing proper chemical management regulations and by phasing out the
    use of lead, nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs), phthalates, perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs),
    formaldehyde and other toxic products found in textiles;

92. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the European External
    Action Service, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States
    and the accession and candidate countries, the Government of the People’s Republic of
    China, the Chinese National People’s Congress, the Taiwanese Government and the
    Taiwanese Legislative Yuan.

K.   whereas President Xi’s popular anti-corruption campaign, launched in 2012 and aimed
     at addressing governance issues by targeting Party, government, military and state-
     owned company officials suspected of corruption, has claimed one high-profile victim
     after another, exposing not only graft but also vast fortunes amassed by Chinese leaders
     and also revealing the infiltration of the political system by powerful criminal networks;

L.   whereas foreign NGOs have been flourishing and playing a vital role for the
     development of local NGOs and the opening-up of China since the reform;

     fight against terrorism the highest priority;

O.   whereas in June 2015 the Hong Kong Legislative Council voted against a controversial
     proposal that would have let Hong Kong voters elect their Chief Executive, but only
     from a pool of candidates vetted by a pro-Beijing committee; whereas precisely this

     resulting in a shift from ‘responsive diplomacy’ to ‘proactive diplomacy’;

     human rights, but is lacking in tangible results as regards improving its human rights
     record;

X.   whereas China has officially and nominally accepted the universality of human rights
     and in the past three decades has opted into the international human rights framework
     by signing a wide range of human rights treaties, and has thus become part of the
     international legal and institutional human rights framework;

Y.   whereas at the beginning of 2015 President Xi publicly announced his intention of
     extending the rule of law throughout the country, out of a conviction that effective
     justice is essential for a modern economy and society in China;

Z.   whereas the CPC recognises five religions, which are ultimately controlled by the

    criticised the absence of a human rights impact assessment in relation to the Investor-

    Wednesday’) movement by wearing only Tibetan clothes, speaking only Tibetan and
    eating only Tibetan food each Wednesday; whereas, to date, more than 140 Tibetans

    the PRC and Taiwan;

EU-China Strategic Partnership and Cooperation

1.   Welcomes the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the EU and China as a
     source of inspiration to strengthen the Strategic Partnership, which is so necessary in a

     results;

2.   Welcomes the outcome of the 17th EU-China Summit of 29 June 2015 lifting bilateral
     relations to a new level and sending out a signal for closer political cooperation going
     beyond mere trade relations and towards a coordinated strategic approach to tackling
     common global challenges and threats; notes that both sides fully recognised the
     progress achieved in the implementation of the EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for
     Cooperation, and that a bilateral review mechanism at the level of officials will be
     established to monitor follow-up; welcomes the fact that both sides agreed at the
     Summit on a set of priorities to reinforce their bilateral cooperation and enhance the
     global dimension of their strategic partnership;

3.   Stresses the need for EU Member States to speak with one voice to the Chinese
     Government, particularly in view of Beijing’s present diplomatic dynamism and
     reshaping of the global governance architecture; underlines the conclusion of the

     negotiations on the Articles of Agreement for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
     (AIIB) and looks forward to a close cooperation of the EU with the AIIB in the future;
     regrets the lack of profound debate and close coordination at EU level regarding
     Member States’ membership of the AIIB; stresses the importance of trade and
     investment policy, as the most obvious area to exert maximum leverage in the strategic
     relationship with China; takes note of the recently developed cooperation between
     China and Central and Eastern European countries, also known as the 16+1 group,
     which includes several EU Member States, but considers that this should not divide the
     EU or weaken its position vis-à-vis China and should also address human rights issues;
     calls on the European External Action Service and the Commission to submit an annual
     report to Parliament on the development of EU-China relations; calls for the
     strengthening of enforceable, rules-based trade and investment with China;

4.   Recognises that China should play a stronger role in multilateral financial institutions
     that better reflects the size of its economy; considers the recently founded AIIB to be an
     opportunity for China to engage as a responsible actor in the multilateral order;
     encourages the new institution to depart from the past mistakes of privileging the
     financing of grandiose infrastructure projects and to prioritise instead technical
     assistance and access to global knowledge, while balancing environmental, social, and
     development priorities;

5.   Considers it of vital importance that the European contribution to the participation in the
     AIIB should include: transparent procedures for the assessment of loans; clear standards
     relating to good governance, social responsibility and the environment; and concern to
     ensure that the debt burden remains controllable for borrowing countries;

6.   Welcomes the participation of several Member States in the AIIB; deplores nonetheless
     the lack of profound debate, close coordination and coordinated response and approach
     at EU level in reaction to the initiatives launched by the Chinese Government to build
     up new multilateral institutions; urges the EU institutions and Member States to see this
     as a wake-up call in order to avoid a similar lack of coordination in the future;

7.   Welcomes the political agreement to improve strategic infrastructure links between the
     EU and China; welcomes, therefore, the decision to establish a new Connectivity
     Platform with the aim of creating a favourable environment for sustainable and
     interoperable cross-border infrastructure networks in countries and regions between the
     EU and China; particularly commends the EU’s readiness to start this project on the
     European level; urges both parties to seize the opportunities given by closely
     interconnecting both partners, including cooperation on infrastructure investment in
     countries along the route of the New Silk Road and the New Maritime Silk Road;

8.   Highlights the vigorous growth of the Chinese economy in the last twenty years and
     underlines that EU Member States should take greater advantage of the opportunities
     offered by this economic development; notes the Chinese interest in strategic
     infrastructure investments in Europe, and underlines the need to cooperate with China
     and other countries in the region in this respect on projects such as China’s Belt and
     Road Initiative and the EU’s Juncker Investment Plan, including rail links, seaports and
     airports; urges the VP/HR and the Commission to reflect on the impact of China’s
     global investment policy, as well as its investment activities in the EU and its Eastern
     Neighbourhood; emphasises, in accordance with the previously adopted positions of
     Parliament and in full respect of INTA competences, the importance of the Bilateral
     Investment Agreement between the EU and China currently under negotiation; calls for

      a fully-fledged sustainable development chapter to be included in the BIT which
      provides for binding commitments with respect to ILO core labour standards and key
      Multilateral Environmental Agreements; underlines the increasing tendency of
      European companies to complain that they are victims of capricious regulation and
      discrimination; stresses the importance of a successful outcome of the ongoing
      investment agreement negotiations in order to further facilitate investment and
      implement investment protection, market access, including public procurement, and fair
      treatment of companies both in Europe and in China; calls for further measures and
      active follow-up to guarantee more balanced trade relations following the elimination of
      trade and investment barriers to European companies; calls on China and the EU to
      further enhance cooperation in order to improve access for SMEs in both market blocs;
      underlines the EU-China commitment to an open global economy and a fair, transparent
      and rules-based trade and investment environment, guaranteeing a level playing field
      and opposing protectionism;

9.    Takes note, in this regard, of the launch of the ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative aimed at
      constructing major energy and communication links across Central, West and South
      Asia as far as Europe; believes that given the geostrategic relevance of this initiative it
      should be pursued in a multilateral way; believes that it is of the utmost importance to
      develop synergies and projects in full transparency and with the involvement of all
      stakeholders;

10.   Calls for enhanced coordination between the EU and China in areas of strategic
      significance such as the G20, security and defence, counter-terrorism, illegal migration,
      transnational crime, nuclear non-proliferation, global and regional security,
      cybersecurity, weapons of mass destruction, energy security, global financial and
      market governance and regulation, climate change, as well as for urbanisation,
      development and aid programmes and sustainable development; emphasises the
      importance of cooperation in the field of regional development and of dialogue and
      exchanges with regard to the Europe 2020 strategy and China’s forthcoming thirteenth
      Five-Year Plan;

11.   Calls on the EEAS to ensure that human rights are high on the agenda in relations and
      dialogues with China;

12.   Calls for the commitments made during the March 2014 visit of President Xi to
      Brussels to deepen exchanges between the EU and China on human rights issues to be
      matched by tangible improvements in the situation on the ground;

13.   Urges the Council and the Commission to engage China further through constructive
      dialogue aimed at encouraging China’s transition to the rule of law and respect for
      human rights and supporting its integration in the world economy;

14.   Welcomes the deepening of the EU-China Urbanisation Partnership; calls for further
      cooperation in urban planning and design, public services, green buildings and smart
      transportation; encourages the launch of new joint programmes involving European and
      Chinese cities and companies;

15.   Welcomes the Joint Statement of the third meeting of the EU-China High Level People-
      to-People Dialogue held on 15 September 2015; underlines the importance of people-to-
      people exchanges and facilitating exchanges for EU and Chinese citizens; supports the
      development of the High-Level People-to-People Dialogue to focus on joint projects

      and shared best practices and to promote people-to-people exchanges; stresses that
      exchange of experts and students between both sides should be especially promoted;

16.   Is concerned about practices of dumping and the lack of transparency with regard to
      Chinese government policies and subsidies through tax credits, land grants, cheap
      credit, subsidised raw materials and other measures;

17.   Is worried about the obstacles European businesses experience on the Chinese market,
      such as forced technology transfers, weak IPR enforcement and discriminatory
      treatment; underlines the importance of market reform in China and of the
      implementation of market economy principles and the elimination of discrimination and
      unjustified restrictions;

18.   Recognises the opportunities arising from Chinese investment in Europe in the
      framework of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI); underlines that,
      while the Fund is open to investment by a number of actors, it should nonetheless
      remain under EU governance;

19.   Acknowledges the challenge of putting China’s economy on a truly sustainable path in
      the framework of the ‘New Normal’; believes that a more prominent participation of
      China in international economic organisations such as the IMF could positively
      contribute to more sustainable and balanced Chinese and global economies, as well as
      to the reform of those organisations; urges the Chinese authorities to provide reliable
      statistics and improve transparency on the state of the economy;

20.   Notes with concern that in recent months the value of Chinese share indexes has
      dropped by a third and there have been hundreds of suspensions of trading owing to
      excessive falls in share prices; expresses its concern in regard to the current financial
      crisis that is striking China and especially its stock markets, and recognises that this
      poses a threat to the global economy given the country’s prominent role in global trade
      and the global financial system; urges the Chinese authorities to tackle the challenge of
      transitioning the current economic model to a sustainable economy; notes that the recent
      plunges on the stock markets in China have brought the government’s control culture
      face to face with the inherent volatility of the financial markets;

21.   Welcomes the fact that over the last decades a considerable number of Chinese citizens
      have been lifted out of extreme poverty thanks to substantial economic growth and a
      gradual opening of the Chinese economy; voices, nonetheless, its concern that these
      economic improvements often cause environmental problems and great inequalities;

22.   Welcomes the fact that in the recent EU-China Joint Statement on Climate Change,
      adopted at the 29 June 2015 summit, both sides expressed their commitment to work
      together to reach an ambitious and legally binding agreement at the Paris Climate
      Conference in 2015; urges all parties to the conference to build on the momentum
      created by the EU-China and US-China climate change statements; stresses the need to
      cooperate in the field of energy in order to tackle jointly the multiple challenges related
      to energy security and global energy architecture;

Internal situation

23.   Notes that under the leadership of President Xi, the Chinese government is showing a
      growing assertiveness both internally and externally; points out that the country’s civil

      rights activists, lawyers, journalists, bloggers, academics and other representatives of
      civil society are now finding their freedom curbed in a way that has not been seen for
      years; observes that China’s human rights record remains a matter of serious concern;

24.   Expresses its deep concern at the imminent adoption of the draft Foreign NGO
      Management Law, as it would mean a further shrinking of space for Chinese civil
      society and would severely restrict freedom of association and expression in the
      country, including by banning ‘overseas NGOs’ that are not registered with the Chinese
      Ministry of Public Security and provincial public security departments from funding
      any Chinese individual or organisation, and prohibiting Chinese groups from
      conducting ‘activities’ on behalf of or with the authorisation of non-registered overseas
      NGOs, including those based in Hong Kong and Macao; calls on the Chinese authorities
      to substantially revise this law in order to bring it in line with international human rights
      standards;

25.   Expresses its concern at the new draft law on cybersecurity, which would bolster and
      institutionalise the practices of cyberspace censorship and monitoring and may force
      European companies to include mandatory backdoors in their IT infrastructure; notes
      the fears of Chinese reforming lawyers and civil rights defenders that this law will
      further restrict freedom of expression and that self-censorship will grow; stresses the
      severe adverse impact of both the cybersecurity and NGO laws on the activities of
      European businesses and institutions in the PRC, and therefore calls on the European
      Council, the EEAS and the Commission to continue to complain forcefully to the
      Chinese authorities against these highly controversial measures; is concerned by
      China´s broad definition of ´national security´ and ´major threats´ in its new national
      security law, which includes ´harmful cultural influences´ as a threat; concludes that this
      law formulates China’s national security interests in so broad and vague a manner as to
      give the Chinese authorities virtually unrestricted powers to move against actions,
      persons or publications they disapprove of;

26.   Expresses its concern that, although the anti-corruption campaign launched by the
      Chinese leadership is a commendable effort to foster citizens’ trust in the government, it
      is characterised by a lack of transparency and in most cases does not follow the rule of
      law; observes that in some cases the campaign is being misused for internal fights and
      to foster the role and power of the CPC; regrets, however, that this campaign has been
      conducted in ways that further undermine the rule of law, with accused officials
      allegedly held in an unlawful detention system, deprived of basic legal protections, and
      often coerced to confess;

27.   Expresses its sympathy with the families and friends of the more than 173 victims of the
      devastating explosions in the port city of Tianjin on 12 August 2015, which displaced
      thousands of residents; notes the increasing number of peaceful mass environmental
      protests in different parts of the country; points to the illegal storage of thousands of
      tonnes of highly toxic chemicals at the illegal distance of less than 600 m from
      residential areas; regards the slow and secretive official information policy concerning
      the Tianjin disaster as highly counterproductive, particularly in combination with the
      censorship of social media reports of this major tragedy; underlines the importance of
      the implementation of all industrial safety standards in accordance with Chinese and
      international legislation, and calls on the Chinese government to raise safety and
      environmental standards of hazardous productions, bringing them in line with China’s
      own laws in the first place;

28.   Notes that the explosions on 12 August 2015 in Tianjin and on 31 August 2015 in
      Dongying make it urgent for China to seriously address the issue of industrial safety, in
      particular in relation to corruption and impunity;

29.   Underlines the urgency of further environmental protection measures, bearing in mind,
      for example, that in 2014 only eight out of 74 major cities reached the national standard
      of PM 2,5 air pollution concentration and given the fact that in China 190 million
      people fall ill due to contaminated water yearly; warns that the double water crisis
      (massive pollution combined with increased water usage) could cause major political
      and social instability; recalls that the cost of China’s environmental degradation is also
      felt in the neighbouring countries; highlights the costs of environmental degradation and
      hopes that the next Five-Year Plan will make the environment a priority; also stresses
      that a lack of environmental protection not only fails to prevent ecological damage, but
      is also a source of unfair competition practices; welcomes the EU-China agreement to
      enhance cooperation to address key environmental challenges such as air, water and soil
      pollution; welcomes the fact that under the new environmental protection law local
      cadres are accountable, also retroactively, for environmental damage caused during their
      tenure and that commitment to environmental protection will count stronger in the
      process of promotion of those local cadres; urges both national and local authorities to
      constructively and actively involve environmental organisations and grassroots
      movements as regards the monitoring, implementation and enforcement of China’s
      environmental policies and initiatives; points out that the June 2015 EU-China Summit
      also established environmental policy and climate change measures under which China
      is to comply with CO2 emissions limits with a view to the Paris Summit in December
      2015 and in line with the objectives of the 2020 Strategic Agenda adopted in Beijing in
      2013;

30.   Welcomes increased EU-China cooperation and exchange of experiences in the field of
      consumer rights and protection, as well as the strengthening of the Chinese
      government’s responsive measures in this respect, as reflected in the stricter rules on
      retailers’ responsibilities under the professional code of conduct in matters including
      return and repair obligations, potential frauds, misleading and fraudulent publicity,
      prepayment arrangements, and protection of consumers’ personal data, particularly in
      view of China’s rapidly expanding internet-based shopping sector;

31.   Observes that in recent years China’s anti-terrorism policy has evolved rapidly from a
      reactive ‘defence against terror’ approach to a proactive ‘war on terror’, along with
      permanent ‘crisis management’ entailing action to an unprecedented extent in affected
      regions and in society; is concerned at the draft law on counter-terrorism, which may
      lead to further violations of the freedoms of expression, assembly, association and
      religion, especially in Tibet and Xinjiang as regions with minority populations;

32.   Stands in solidarity with the people of China in their efforts to combat terrorism and
      extremism; expresses its concern, however, that the definition of ‘terrorist’ included in
      China’s draft law on counter-terrorism may, if not substantially revised, give scope for
      the penalisation of almost any peaceful expression of Tibetan culture, religion or
      identity that may differ from those of the state;

33.   Calls on China to increase internet freedom and to respect the cybersecurity of all
      countries;

34.   Is concerned at the fact that Xinjiang is caught in a vicious circle, given that, on the one
      hand, there are violent separatist and extremist groups among the Turkic-speaking
      Muslim Uighurs, who do not, however, represent the vast majority, and that, on the
      other hand, Beijing, for the sake of stability, is increasingly responding to social unrest
      with repression, heightening the presence of its security apparatus in the region,
      alienating many Uighurs from Beijing and nourishing anti-Han-Chinese sentiments
      among the Uighur population; deplores the marginalisation of Uighur culture in
      Xinjiang, including forbidding Uighur civil servants to visit mosques and in some
      places to observe Ramadan; calls on the Chinese authorities to make every effort to
      develop a genuine dialogue with the Uighur community, and to protect the cultural
      identity of the Uighur population; notes with concern the travel restrictions, notably in
      Tibet and Xinjiang, that can be imposed upon EU citizens, particularly in the case of
      diplomats and journalists; notes that no such restrictions apply to Chinese citizens
      (including diplomats and journalists) across EU Member States; strongly urges
      therefore that steps be taken to enforce the principle of reciprocity;

35.   Expresses its sympathy and solidarity with the people of Hong Kong in support of
      democratic reforms; highlights that Hong Kong’s autonomy is guaranteed by the Basic
      Law; holds that the introduction of fully-fledged universal suffrage in the Special
      Administrative Region is fully compatible with the ‘One country, two systems’
      principle; deplores the fact that the reform of the electoral law for the appointment of
      the Chief Executive in Hong Kong could not be completed; expresses its hope that a
      new reform process can be started in the near future with the aim of giving the people of
      Hong Kong the right to direct universal suffrage in 2017, with a genuine choice
      amongst diverse candidates; welcomes the Joint Report of 24 April 2015 of the
      European External Action Service and the European Commission to the European
      Parliament and the Council: ‘Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Annual
      Report 2014’, and supports the EU’s commitment to strengthening democracy,
      including the rule of law, independence of the judicial system, fundamental freedoms
      and rights, transparency and freedom of information and expression in Hong Kong;

36.   Strongly supports ‘One country, two systems’ as a basis for good relations between the
      Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao and mainland China;

37.   Expresses its concern at the recent political and civil unrest in Hong Kong, and calls on
      China to abide by its obligations to the people of Hong Kong to preserve their rights and
      freedoms, under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984;

External situation

38.   Notes that since its launch President Xi’s ‘Chinese Dream’ of national rejuvenation
      foresees a stronger and more proactive role for China in the world; encourages the
      VP/HR to explore the possibilities of developing a common approach to China with the
      US wherever this would contribute to advancing EU interests; stresses that China’s
      persistent rise as a global power requires a continuous and rapid reconsideration of
      Europe’s strategic priorities in its relations with China, as a matter of urgency;
      underlines the need for a world power like China to contribute, in a globalised and
      interdependent context and in a more active and constructive manner, to confronting
      global challenges and regional conflicts and to attaining a multilateral world order that
      respects international law, universal values and peace; considers that China should
      increasingly take its place among the world’s leading countries, acting according to the
      rules set for all;

39.   Notes the priority given by President Xi’s presidency to the relationship with the US,
      given his proposal for a ‘new type of major power relationship’ between China, the US
      and other regional actors; favours a more constructive approach to a new world order
      which China should help construe and integrate, one founded on the universal values of
      human rights, democracy and human security; calls on the EU to be more active in Asia,
      and to cooperate with China, the US and other regional actors for more stability in the
      region;

40.   Emphasises that the recent White Paper on China’s military strategy states Beijing’s
      intentions to further expand the Chinese navy and extend the range of its operations,
      shifting from ‘offshore waters defence’ to ‘open seas protection’; deplores the unilateral
      establishment of an air-defence identification zone and the consequent claim over
      navigational air control within Japanese and South Korean territory; calls for a balanced
      attitude, to avoid worries on the part of China’s neighbours and more tension in the
      Pacific and Indian Oceans and guarantee Europe’s crucial interest in freedom of
      navigation on the seas;

41.   Considers it regrettable that, contrary to the 2002 Declaration of Conduct, several
      parties are reclaiming land in the Spratly Islands, and is especially concerned about the
      massive scale of China’s present efforts, which include building military facilities, ports
      and at least one airstrip; specifically warns against the looming danger of an increased
      presence of and confrontation between rival naval vessels and air patrols in the area and
      of the possible establishment of an air defence identification zone (IDAZ) over the
      South China Sea;

42.   Remains alarmed at the escalating tension between parties in the South China Sea and
      calls, therefore, on all parties involved to avoid unilateral provocative actions in the
      South China Sea and stresses the importance of peaceful settlement of disputes, based
      on international law and with the help of impartial international mediation such as the
      UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS); considers it regrettable that China
      refuses to acknowledge the jurisdiction of both UNCLOS and the Court of Arbitration;
      urges China to reconsider its stance and calls on all the parties including China to
      respect the eventual decision of UNCLOS ; considers that a way forward for a possible
      peaceful resolution of the tension in the areas of the South and East China Seas is the
      negotiation and joint implementation of codes of conduct for the peaceful exploitation
      of the maritime areas in question, including the establishment of safe trade routes and
      quotas for fishing or attribution of areas for resource exploration; endorses the urgent
      call by the 26th ASEAN Summit for the speedy adoption of a Code of Conduct in the
      South China Sea; welcomes the agreement reached recently between China and ASEAN
      to speed up consultations on a Code of Conduct for the disputes in the South China Sea;
      takes note of Taiwan’s ‘South China Sea Peace Initiative’ aimed at reaching a
      consensus on a code of conduct and the establishment of a mechanism allowing all sides
      to cooperate in the joint exploitation of natural and marine resources in the region;
      supports all actions enabling the South China Sea to become a ‘Sea of Peace and
      Cooperation’;

43.   Calls on the VP/HR to identify the risks to peace and security in the region as well as
      globally should armed conflict arise in the East and South China Seas, in line with the
      priorities set forth in the European Maritime Security Strategy, what risks this would
      entail for the freedom and safety of navigation in the region, and what risks exist there
      to specific European interests; considers that since other actors (notably Australia) are

      already significantly active politically in the Pacific, the EU should rely on bilateral and
      multilateral cooperation in order to effectively contribute to security in the region;

44.   Urges the Chinese Government to use all its levers of influence to ensure stability in the
      Korean peninsula and to induce North Korea to return to credible denuclearisation talks
      and take concrete steps to denuclearise; reminds that China remains North Korea’s most
      important ally, and therefore encourages the Chinese government, together with the
      international community, to play a constructive role in urgently addressing the dire
      human rights situation in North Korea, including dealing with the thousands of North
      Korea refugees who cross the border into China fleeing appalling conditions at home;
      urges the Chinese government, in accordance with its obligations as a state party to the
      UN Refugee Convention, not to deny these refugees their right to seek asylum or
      forcibly return them to North Korea, but to protect their fundamental human rights; calls
      on the EU to exert diplomatic pressure on the Chinese Government to that effect, in line
      with its global objectives of non-proliferation;

45.   Urges the Chinese government to exert influence on Pakistan to persuade that country to
      refrain from fuelling instability in the region;

46.   Welcomes the cooperation between the EU and China on security and defence,
      including the anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden, and calls for further combined
      efforts to tackle global security and defence issues such as terrorism;

47.   Draws Beijing’s attention to the indispensable role of the US and the EU with regard to
      China’s modernisation goals; moreover, reminds Beijing of its international obligations
      and responsibilities in terms of contributing to peace and global security, as a permanent
      member of the UN Security Council; regrets, in this regard, the fact that China, in
      partnership with Russia, has continuously blocked UN action on Syria, where a deadly
      war is being waged by Bashar al Assad on the Syrian people, for over four years now;

48.   Underlines the importance of mutual trust and cooperation between China and the EU
      and the other key international actors to tackle global security issues; hopes that China
      will offer its support to the EU- and US-led initiatives aiming at ending the breaches of
      international law causing the conflict in Eastern Ukraine and at restoring the territorial
      integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine after Russia’s aggression;

Human rights situation

49.   Notes that a strong contradiction exists between the official Chinese aspiration to the
      universality of human rights and the worsening human rights situation; notes that the
      recent worsening of the situation of human rights and freedoms in China started in 2013
      and has intensified an already existing crackdown over the population, limiting the
      space for expression and peaceful advocacy for civil society even further; is deeply
      worried at the arrest, trial and sentencing of numerous civil rights activists, human
      rights defenders and government critics and at the fact that more than 100 human rights
      lawyers and activists have been detained or questioned by Chinese police; calls on the
      Chinese authorities to release those in custody and to ensure that they can exercise their
      profession without hindrance;

50.   Believes that strong ongoing EU-China relations must provide an effective platform for
      a mature, meaningful and open human rights dialogue based on mutual respect; further

      believes that the 40th anniversary of EU-China relations in 2015 provides a real
      opportunity for progress in this area;

51.   Urges the EU to continue pressing for an improvement of the human rights situation in
      China whenever dialogues are held at any level and to include human rights clauses in
      any bilateral treaty agreed with China;

52.   Welcomes the 33rd EU-China Dialogue on Human Rights of 8 and 9 December 2014;
      notes that the dialogue, together with pressure from other international partners, has
      contributed to some concrete actions; stresses that the EU has made it clear on several
      occasions that it wanted the dialogue to achieve more tangible improvements in the
      human rights situation on the ground;

53.   Recalls that the universality of human rights has always been at the heart of EU-China
      human rights dialogues; notes with concern that in the official Chinese view
      universality is questioned on grounds of cultural differences, and that this has been an
      important source of conceptual differences leading to lack of understanding and distrust
      in EU-China relations and limiting progress in the EU-China human rights dialogues;
      calls, therefore, on the Chinese leadership to reconsider how it approaches the question
      and to respect the universality of human rights consistent with the Universal Declaration
      of Human Rights; urges further that the EU institutions work together with the Chinese
      authorities in their dialogues in order to advance respect for universality;

54.   Remains highly concerned that China is currently the world’s largest executioner and
      continues to impose the death penalty in secret on thousands of people annually,
      without regard to international minimum standards on the use of the death penalty;
      emphasises once again that abolition of the death penalty contributes to the
      enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights;

55.   Remains concerned at the persisting severe restrictions on freedom of expression,
      association, assembly, and religion, as well on the activities of human rights
      organisations;

56.   Deplores the often discriminatory treatment of religious and ethnic minorities in China;

57.   Criticises the fact that while in China freedom of religion is not a right nominally
      guaranteed by the constitution, in practice the government restricts religious practices to
      officially approved and recognised religious organisations; supports the resistance of
      Chinese churches to the government’s renewed strategy of ‘sinicisation’ of Christianity;
      condemns, in particular, the ongoing anti-Christian campaign in the province of
      Zhejiang, during which dozens of churches were demolished and more than 400 crosses
      removed in 2014; shares the concerns of churches about other provinces where there is
      a strong Christian presence; condemns, moreover, the anti-Buddhism campaigns carried
      out via the ‘patriotic education’ approach, including measures to state-manage Tibetan
      Buddhist Monasteries; condemns ‘legal education’ programmes for Buddhist monks
      and nuns; cannot understand or accept the ban on images of the Dalai Lama in China; is
      concerned that China’s criminal law is being abused to persecute Tibetans and
      Buddhists, whose religious activities are equated with ‘separatism’, and sees its
      concerns confirmed as monks and nuns now account for approximately 44 % of
      political prisoners in Tibet; deplores the fact that the environment for practising
      Buddhism in Tibet has worsened significantly after the Tibetan protests of March 2008,
      with the Chinese government adopting a more pervasive approach to ‘patriotic

      education’, including measures to micromanage Tibetan Buddhist monastic affairs, for
      instance through unelected management committees installed in every monastery, ‘legal
      education’ programmes for monks and nuns to ensure that they ‘do not take part in
      activities of splitting up the motherland and disturbing social order’, and a ban on
      images of the Dalai Lama;

58.   Notes that certain commitments have been put forward by President Xi to
      ‘comprehensively advance ruling the country according to the law’, along with
      combating corruption; is, however, deeply concerned at the recent round-up of over 200
      lawyers, particularly lawyers focusing on human rights cases, with many of them
      accused of ‘disrupting public order’ and of seeking to undermine the Party, when the
      authorities have claimed that such drastic measures are in fact a defence of China’s
      legal system; stresses that these measures contradict the authorities’ claim to advance
      the rule of law and undermine any effort undertaken for political reform;

59.   Recalls that in the official Chinese view socio-economic rights continue to be prioritised
      over individual civil and political rights, whereas in the European understanding these
      rights are considered fundamental and equally important and economic development
      and human rights go together, reflecting differences in European and Chinese
      perceptions of human rights that are visible in official positions; further stresses that the
      comprehensive protection of human rights is essential for continued economic growth in
      China, and therefore urges the Chinese authorities to ensure the respect of both socio-
      economic and civil and political rights;

60.   Criticises China’s highly restrictive media environment and tightly controlled digital
      domain, where foreign, including European, web content is blocked and domestic
      content deemed politically threatening is routinely deleted and censored; strongly
      protests against the high number of Chinese citizens jailed for offences involving
      freedom of expression, especially on the internet;

61.   Is deeply concerned that the Chinese government is continuing its hardline policies
      against the Tibetan people, especially by rejecting the Dalai Lama’s ‘Middle Way
      Approach’ which seeks neither independence nor separation but a genuine autonomy
      within the framework of the Constitution of the PRC; calls for the Chinese government
      to re-enter into a dialogue with Tibetan representatives; protests against the
      marginalisation of Tibetan culture by the CPC, and urges the Chinese authorities to
      respect the freedoms of expression, association and religion of the Tibetan people;
      deplores the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Tibet, which has led to an
      increase in self-immolation cases; notes with concern the recently passed
      criminalisation measures relating to self-immolation aimed at punishing those allegedly
      associated with self-immolators; deplores the forceful resettlement of over 2 million
      Tibetan nomads and herders since 2006 in the so-called ‘New Socialist Village’, as they
      are cut off from medical care, education and prosperity; is equally concerned at the
      ongoing transfer of Han Chinese populations into Tibet; expresses its concern regarding
      the cases of torture, disappearance and arbitrary detention and the denial of access to
      medical care for prisoners, including monk Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and 10 other
      prominent Tibetan prisoners; demands a detailed investigation of all death in prison
      cases; is deeply concerned at the degradation of Tibet’s environment; underlines that the
      Tibetan plateau is warming up fast, and that this may cause the melting of Tibet’s
      glaciers, many of which feed the largest rivers in Asia;

62.   Urges European companies investing in China to respect international labour standards
      and to make commitments to go beyond Chinese labour rights, if these do not meet
      internationally agreed standards;

Cross-strait relations

63.   Considers that both China and Taiwan are important economic partners of the EU in
      Asia and the Pacific; welcomes any significant improvement of cross-strait relations;
      advocates negotiating a bilateral investment agreement between the EU and Taiwan,
      given that Taiwan is, at regional level, the best gateway and springboard to China for
      EU businesses and that numerous states – including the People’s Republic of China –
      have concluded such (de facto) agreements with Taiwan;

64.   Takes note of the Chinese government’s non-objection to Taiwan’s participation in
      some UN organisations (WHO, ICAO); expresses its concern at the Chinese
      government’s reaffirmation of the 2005 Anti-Secession Law that allows for the use of
      military means in the case of a declaration of independence by Taiwan; deplores the fact
      that there are still 1 500 long-range missiles aimed at Taiwan from southern China;
      takes the view that a gradual demilitarisation of the region would further facilitate the
      rapprochement of the parties; emphasises that all cross-Strait disputes should be settled
      by peaceful means on the basis of international law; stresses that the meeting on 23 May
      2015 on Kinmen Island between top officials from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
      was an encouraging step; notes that this meeting was the third formal meeting between
      the chiefs of cross-Strait affairs from China and Taiwan; supports initiatives that
      develop Cross-Strait relations in a peaceful way;

                                                o

                                            o       o

65.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the EEAS, the
      Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and of the
      accession and candidate countries, the Government of the People’s Republic of China,
      the Chinese National People’s Congress, the Taiwanese Government and the Taiwanese
      Legislative Yuan.

– having regard to Rule 48 of its Rules of Procedure,

– having regard to the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (A7-0434/2012),

A. whereas the EU-China strategic partnership is of great importance for relations between the
   EU and China, and whereas this relationship is paramount for finding answers to global
   concerns, such as global and regional security, the economic crisis, global financial and
   market regulation, energy security, weapons of mass destruction and nuclear
   non-proliferation, climate change, the economic and social development of a market
   economy, the promotion of democracy and human rights and the fight against organised
   crime, terrorism and piracy, as well as in creating a framework to address bilateral concerns
   between the EU and China;

B. whereas a strategic partnership requires a strong commitment to mutual responsibility and a
   good level of confidence, and must be based on universal values;

C. whereas EU-China relations have developed considerably since the signing of the EU-China
   cooperation agreement in 1985; whereas the Commission adopted its main political strategy
   on China in 2006 and, in this context, launched negotiations in January 2007 on a
   comprehensive partnership and cooperation agreement with a view to further improving
   relations between the EU and China, in particular in the field of trade and investment;

D. whereas China is undergoing a process of socio-economic transition from an extensive
   model based on a state-controlled economy to a model based on more economic freedoms,
   which in turn has allowed a large proportion of the Chinese population to raise its standard
   of living;

E. whereas, however, similar progress has not been made in the field of political liberties;

F. whereas human rights are complementary, universal, inalienable, indivisible and
   interdependent; whereas China shows its preoccupation with economic and social human
   rights (e.g. food, clothing, economic development) while the EU takes a broader approach
   to human rights, including and with a particular emphasis on civil and political rights (e.g.
   freedom of speech, religion and association);

G. whereas Chinese civil rights activists have reported on the deprivation of their liberty when
   they disappeared in police custody for several months, without any arrest warrant,
   indictment, contact with their families or legal aid;

H. whereas already in 2007 President Hu Jintao instructed the highest level of the judiciary that
   judges should be guided by three ‘supremacies’– the party, the people and the law, in that
   order – and whereas the Chinese Ministry of Justice decreed in March 2012 that all lawyers
   should swear an oath of allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in order to
   obtain or renew their licence;

I. whereas the shocking news of mid-June 2012 regarding the extremely cruel forced abortion
   of the unborn daughter of seven-month-pregnant Feng Jianmei fuelled the debate on the
   abolition of the official one-child policy;

J. whereas, despite the Chinese Government’s progress in promoting some economic and
   social rights, the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly,
   press freedom and the right to join a trade union is persistently repressed; whereas human
   rights organisations continue to report serious human rights abuses by the Chinese
   authorities, including the sentencing of high-profile dissidents such as imprisoned Nobel
   Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, expanded restrictions on media and internet freedom,
   tightened surveillance and harassment of lawyers, human rights defenders and non-
   governmental organisations, broadened control and oppression of Uighurs, Tibetans and
   their freedoms, and increasing numbers of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions,
   including in secret, unlawful detention facilities known as ‘black jails’; whereas repressive
   policies against Tibetans’ basic freedoms have triggered a worrying number of self-
   immolations in recent years;

K. whereas China is a State Party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
   (ICCPR) and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council; whereas this
   status entails a special duty for China to abide by its international legal obligations under
   the ICCPR and the Charter of the United Nations;

L. whereas Hu Jia, the 2008 Sakharov Prize laureate, remains under house arrest and is subject
   to extensive surveillance and restricted communication;

M. whereas the Chinese state recognises only five religions, namely Buddhism, Daoism, Islam
   and Christianity (both Catholicism and Protestantism); whereas all of these religions have
   centralised governing bodies with headquarters in Beijing and are staffed by officials loyal

   to the CCP; whereas the CCP appoints top religious leaders and has banned non-approved
   religious groups such as Falun Gong since 1999 with the aim of eradicating the practice;
   whereas, as a consequence of this ban, human rights organisations have reported extralegal
   coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, forced labour and physical torture, sometimes
   resulting in death;

N. whereas the Tibet Autonomous Region, other Tibetan autonomous areas and the Xinjiang
   Uyghur Autonomous Region have become increasingly important as regards China’s
   strategic, regional, military and economic considerations and are therefore seen by the
   Chinese Government as core issues for China’s territorial integrity; whereas since 2009 at
   least 90 Tibetans have self-immolated in Tibetan-populated areas of the People’s Republic
   of China (PRC), including the Tibet Autonomous Region and Tibetan autonomous areas
   within the Gansu, Sichuan and Qinghai provinces;

O. whereas, although the opening-up of the Chinese economy has brought major benefits such
   as better access to the employment market and a fall in rural unemployment, not all
   segments of the Chinese population have benefited equally from China’s economic growth
   and there are large disparities emerging between urban and rural parts of the country;

P. whereas inequalities between urban and rural populations in terms of income and access to
   employment, social welfare, healthcare and education constitute a significant cohesion
   policy challenge for China;

Q. whereas EU-China cooperation in the field of science and technology is a matter of
   common interest; whereas internet use has spread in China and there are now more than 500
   million users forming an online body of public opinion; whereas, however, the country’s
   internet environment remains very restrictive;

R. whereas the EU is the world’s leading tourist destination, whereas 100 million Chinese are
   expected to travel abroad by 2020 and whereas it is therefore necessary to support initiatives
   aimed at attracting these new tourist flows;

S. whereas China is the world’s biggest carbon dioxide emitter and whereas emission levels
   are still increasing rapidly; whereas China’s per capita CO2 emissions reached 6.8 tonnes in
   2010 and are expected to overtake US per capita emissions by 2017;

T. whereas China is stepping up its efforts as regards market-based emissions trading systems;
   whereas China is carrying out seven pilot projects in this area with the purpose of
   establishing a national emissions trading scheme in 2015;

U. whereas the 21st century is seeing China return to the world scene as an economic and
   commercial power, on account of its rapidly growing economic power and opaque military
   build-up;

V. whereas the EU adheres to its one-China policy in the context of cross-Strait relations
   between the PRC and Taiwan;

W. whereas the positive role played by the PRC in South-East Asia in terms of economic
   regionalisation and dynamics is becoming increasingly overshadowed by territorial disputes
   in the South China Sea with Vietnam. Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines and
   Taiwan, and in the East China Sea with Japan and Taiwan – all areas rich in fish and in oil

   and gas reserves;

X. whereas China maintains close relations with North Korea, the latter being largely
   economically dependent on the former, with an inflow of Chinese money and tourists being
   vital to the survival of the Pyongyang regime in its current state;

Y whereas China is cooperating with Russia, four Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan,
  Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) and four observer countries (India, Iran, Mongolia
  and Pakistan) in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO); whereas Chinese
  investments in Central Asia will rise in the next decade from USD 20 billion to
  USD 100 billion, as announced at the SCO Summit in Beijing on 6 June 2012;

Z. whereas the deepening relations between Beijing and Washington, along with the strong
   financial and economic ties between the two countries, constitute one of the world’s most
   significant bilateral relationships; whereas Europe is China’s first trading partner;

AA. whereas nowhere in the world is China’s explosive growth more visible than in Africa and
    Latin America; whereas this is illustrated in particular by the impressive rise in China’s
    mutual trade volume in Africa, which increased by 80 % between 2009 and 2011 to
    USD 166,3 billion, according to statistics released by the Chinese Trade Ministry; whereas
    Chinese foreign direct investment in Africa rose by 58,9 % in 2011 to USD 1,7 billion;
    whereas Chinese interests in Africa are visible through major development projects such as
    railways, roads and social welfare projects;

EU-China Strategic Partnership and cooperation

1. Supports the public commitment made by the EU and China during their High-Level
   Strategic Dialogue of 9-10 July 2012 in Beijing to setting a good example of international
   cooperation in the 21st century through their Strategic Partnership based on shared interests
   and mutual understanding; supports and encourages the almost 60 sectoral dialogues
   between the EU and China, with the conviction that an enhanced and highly developed
   partnership will be mutually beneficial to both the EU and China; wishes, however, to see a
   strengthening of these dialogues in the fields of human rights, the environment, security,
   energy and in particular the fight against counterfeit products, in view of its impact on
   public health and safety; encourages efforts to actively seek synergies between China’s 12th
   Five-Year Plan and the Europe 2020 strategy with a view to deepening pragmatic
   cooperation in various fields; believes, moreover, that the concept of strategic partnership
   must be better defined; calls for increased trade and economic relations with China to go
   hand in hand with considerable progress in the political dialogue on human rights and the
   rule of law;

2. Expects Member States to give the European External Action Service (EEAS) and
   especially its Delegation in Beijing a clear mandate to strengthen the EU-China Strategic
   Partnership by speaking with one voice to the Chinese Government, and to refrain from
   implementing bilateral foreign policy initiatives that may jeopardise the efforts being made
   by the EEAS; calls for the EU to implement a long-term strategy vis-à-vis China, providing
   operational coordination both between the institutions of the Union and between the Union
   and its Member States; expects the Chinese authorities, at all political levels, to strengthen
   the EU-China Strategic Partnership through the consistent and transparent application of
   mutual and international agreements and rules;

3. Welcomes the agreements reached during the 15th EU-China Summit held in Brussels on
   20 September 2012; urges their swift operationalisation and implementation, which will
   strengthen relations between the Union and China;

4. Welcomes also the commitments made at the 15th EU-China Summit, in particular
   regarding the negotiation of an agreement on investment and the establishment of a regular
   dialogue on defence and security issues;

5. Considers that relations between the EU and China, both at the economic and trade levels
   and at the cultural and social levels, could be one of the major factors in the development
   and betterment of both societies and therefore sees this cooperation as vital for the interests
   of both sides;

6. Welcomes the launch and successful first round of the EU-China High-Level
   People-to-People Dialogue; expresses satisfaction with the progress and achievements of
   the EU-China Year of Intercultural Dialogue and takes note of the agreement reached at the
   15th EU-China Summit on a series of follow-up actions in various areas relating to
   education, culture, multilingualism and youth;

7. Calls on the Commission, the Council and the relevant Chinese authorities to facilitate, in
   cooperation with Parliament, tourist flows from China to the EU by harmonising and
   accelerating procedures for issuing visas for Chinese nationals, particularly in the context of
   business and conference travel;

8. Welcomes the call made by both sides at the 15th EU-China Summit for the launch of a
   comprehensive EU-China dialogue on mobility and migration at an appropriate level and
   their mutual undertaking to continue to explore ways of facilitating exchanges for Chinese
   ad EU citizens, including mutual visa exemptions for holders of diplomatic passports;

9. Emphasises that China is not only the world’s second-largest economy and biggest exporter
   in the global economy, but also an increasingly important political power;

Internal situation

10. Stresses that China, in recent decades, has achieved significant social progress; emphasises
    that such an improvement in the quality of life in a huge country in such a short period of
    time is unique in history; notes that China’s economic growth has lifted more than half a
    billion people out of poverty since 1990;

11. Takes note of the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), approved by the National People’s
    Congress in March 2012, which is intended to tackle the negative side-effects of an
    unparalleled period of sustained high economic growth, such as acute environmental
    threats, regional imbalances, rising income inequality and continuing collective protests
    centred on social, economic and legal grievances;

12. Notes the importance of identifying common ground between the Europe 2020 strategy and
    China’s 12th Five-Year-Plan;

13. Welcomes China’s successful economic policy, but shares the criticism made by
    independent Chinese scholars and observers that the preservation of this trend is seriously
    threatened by corruption scandals, a lack of transparency and a ‘red aristocracy’ of close

   family members of former and present party leaders who possess enormous fortunes owing
   to their political and economic connections, a grave situation which was recently laid bare
   by the Bo Xilai affair;

14. Looks forward to the speedy implementation of the repeated calls for democratisation and
    political reforms inside the CCP by the new party leadership; believes that only effective
    political reforms aimed at shaping inclusive, democratic and accountable institutions that
    reflect China’s ethnic, religious, political and social diversity will pave the way for building
    sustainable growth and stability and curb the semi-independence of high-handed provincial,
    district and local party bosses, who badly damage the reputation of China’s national
    leadership both internally and externally through their abuses of power, with particular
    reference to the very costly and endemic cases of corruption; considers that such cases
    should be tackled through the introduction of accountability mechanisms, as acknowledged
    by Chairman Hu Jintao during the 18th CCP Congress of November 2012;

15. Shares and supports the vehement rejection by Chinese lawyers of a compulsory oath of
    allegiance to the CCP on the grounds that it is an attack on the legal system which blatantly
    disregards international legal standards, because any lawyer should swear allegiance to the
    constitution and not to a political party or organisation;

16. Emphasises that, although forced abortions are strictly illegal in China, family-planning
    officials repeatedly coerce women into inhumane practices such as forced abortions or
    sterilisation; condemns the so-called ‘social maintenance fee’, an often-exorbitant fine that
    parents have to pay in the event of extra births, as was the case in the tragedy of
    Feng Jianmei; points out that official statistics show that in 2011 there were 8 400
    complaints from victims about misconduct by family-planning authorities; wholeheartedly
    supports Chinese voices calling for an end to the one-child policy, with its many loopholes,
    particularly in the light of demographic trends in China, while stressing its severe negative
    social and psychological consequences such as social disparities, a worsening gender
    equality situation, widespread negative feeling about the birth of a female child and the still-
    growing imbalance between baby boys and girls, which is creating ‘little emperors’,
    disrupting the traditional family structure and, moreover, reducing the intake of young
    people in the labour market; calls on the Chinese leadership to consider it a top priority to
    find a solution to this problem;

17. Takes serious account of the vigorous protests by workers at the Foxconn plant and
    demands that workers’ rights be respected; supports the pursuit of decent pay and decent
    working conditions;

18. Welcomes China’s efforts to establish a nationwide emissions trading system by 2015,
    which could in the future be integrated with other carbon trading systems, in particular the
    EU’s Emissions Trading System; notes, however, that China does not yet have a
    fully-functioning, mature market economy, which is a clear prerequisite for a
    well-functioning emissions trading system;

19. Urges the Chinese Government to step up the measuring of pollutants and emissions in
    order to overcome the lack of reliable carbon emission data, to establish a better legal
    infrastructure and to increase capacity-building at an administrative level; welcomes, in this
    connection, the financing agreement of 20 September 2012 between the EU and China,
    which promotes the environment, the transition towards a low-carbon economy and the
    reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in China;

20. Takes note of the decision of Hong Kong’s Chief Executive not to force the implementation
    of a controversial ‘national education’ curriculum following mass demonstrations and
    widespread opposition; calls on the Beijing authorities fully to respect the ‘one country-two
    systems’ principle in compliance with the agreement signed before the handover of the
    former British colony to the PRC; welcomes the high turnout in the recent Legislative
    Council elections and expects universal suffrage to be introduced for the election of all the
    members of this assembly as soon as possible;

Human rights and democracy

21. Admires and supports the courage and activism of those Chinese citizens acting in socially
    responsible ways to promote and defend universally recognised social and human rights,
    and to challenge and correct well-known social dangers and/or criminal acts such as
    corruption, abuses of office, environmental damage, AIDS infection, food poisoning,
    construction fraud in relation to schools, and illegal land and property expropriation, often
    committed by local party authorities; denounces all instances of official retaliation against
    these Chinese citizens; urges the Chinese leadership to encourage civil responsibility in
    terms of observing social human rights and to rehabilitate officially persecuted and
    punished defenders of these rights; reminds the Chinese leadership to comply strictly with
    domestic and international human rights law;

22. Strongly endorses the critical comments of Chinese lawyers and jurists that the humiliating
    detainment of suspects for more than 15 days conflicts with the International Covenant on
    Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which China signed in October 1998; expresses its
    concern at the unwillingness of the Chinese Government to ratify the ICCPR, a situation
    which is still pending; deplores the fact that under the new Criminal Procedures Law of
    2013 police and state security authorities can even detain a suspect for more than 14 months
    without any assistance from a lawyer; fully supports the criticism of Chinese jurists that the
    police retain the option not only of keeping suspects under house arrest, but also of
    detaining them under the rules on ‘arrest at a determined place’; backs all initiatives by
    Chinese jurists with a view to real reform of the PRC’s Criminal Procedures Law;

23. Calls on China to comply with minimum social standards; underlines the importance of
    compliance with, and rapid implementation of, all International Labour Organisation rules,
    including the right freely to form independent trade unions; welcomes the implementation
    of the labour contract law and calls for the legislative framework to be supplemented by the
    adoption of a law on collective bargaining; urges both the Chinese authorities and European
    investors and companies operating in China to observe international labour standards and to
    guarantee decent pay and working conditions and respect for human rights in China; takes
    the view that the EU should not allow market access for goods which have been produced
    by means of child labour or in facilities which gravely violate international labour standards
    and human rights, such as prison camps;

24. Takes the view that the trade imbalances between the EU and China reflect their differing
    social, economic and democratic models; takes the view that the limited or non-existent
    degree of respect for certain rights in China is a contributing factor; stresses the importance
    of identifying a strategy for dialogue with China, starting with labour market issues;

25. Fears that the number of prisoners being executed under China‘s death penalty legislation,
    as well as the expediency of their trials and subsequent executions, goes against the spirit of
    the human right to a free and fair trial, in that the speed used by Chinese authorities means

   that mistrials and other errors could be overlooked, leading to the execution of innocent
   people; considers that the application of the death penalty within an opaque judicial system,
   which lacks full transparency and in which the rights of the prisoner are as yet still not fully
   developed, is a grave error; calls on the Chinese authorities to reconsider their policy on
   capital punishment;

26. Stresses that the Strategic Partnership between the EU and China includes freedom of the
    media on a reciprocal basis, which implies press freedom for the Chinese media in Europe
    and also press freedom for European media in China; expects all the European institutions
    strongly to advocate this fundamental human rights principle in their contacts with their
    respective Chinese partners;

27. Deplores the control and censorship of the internet by the Chinese authorities; notes with
    concern that the Chinese Government is tightening its surveillance of the internet by means
    of a new law that forbids people from betraying state secrets, harming national pride,
    endangering the country’s ethnic unity or making calls for ‘illegal protests’ or ‘mass
    meetings’; notes that there is therefore no longer any real limit on censorship or persecution;
    is concerned by the lack of safeguards provided under the new law, making it possible to
    use it in an abusive way; emphasises that the terms ‘illegal protests’ and ‘mass meetings’
    should only be used in situations where a law on peaceful and legal protests exists and is
    effective; encourages the Chinese Government to allow the expression of a plurality of
    opinions on the internet, in the media and, more generally, in the public sphere; recalls that
    the right to freedom of expression on the internet has recently been recognised by the UN
    Human Rights Council;

28. Is concerned about the entry into force of the new provisions relating to control of the
    internet, which legalise the closure of blogs and lay down stiff penalties for bloggers,
    journalists, and lawyers who defend them;

29. Stresses that in a country with more than 500 million internet users, digital freedoms are the
    only way to achieve a flourishing and developed cyberspace; calls on the Chinese
    authorities both to secure and to protect the huge cybersphere developed in their country
    and to target their efforts towards its enhancement and not towards censorship and control;

30. Takes note of the significant efforts made by the Chinese Government to develop Tibet and
    Xinjiang economically, and of the impact of those efforts on nomad communities and
    traditional livelihoods; urges the Chinese Government to act in a politically responsible way
    by meaningfully engaging the Tibetan and Uighur peoples in governance issues, including
    resource management and economic development priorities, and respecting rather than
    diluting cultural elements such as language and religion; strongly asserts that the Chinese
    Government will not achieve lasting stability in Tibet or Xinjiang or comity among the
    Chinese, Tibetan and Uighur peoples through forcible assimilation, cultural destruction or
    repressive police and security methods, but only by seriously addressing all indigenous
    complaints in order to create genuinely shared responsibility for the well-being of both
    autonomous provinces; urges the Chinese Government to put an end to the ban on
    independent observers visiting these regions;

31. Stresses that, notwithstanding a harsh policy of repression, a religious revival is taking place
    in China which is demonstrated by the reopening or reconstruction of countless places of
    worship; urges the Chinese authorities to pull back on policies and practices that curtail any
    citizen’s fundamental right to freedom of religion and belief;

32. Calls on the Chinese authorities to grant Protestant house churches and underground
    Catholic churches, as well as those of other religions, official recognition; recalls, in this
    connection, that international human rights law recognises freedom of religion or belief
    regardless of registration status, meaning that registration should not be a mandatory
    precondition for practising one’s religion; strongly condemns all attempts by the authorities
    to deprive these non-registered churches of their fundamental right to freedom of religion
    by imposing the requirement to operate under government-controlled management boards,
    confiscating their property and even using detention and imprisonment in an effort to
    silence them, thereby interfering with their religious autonomy and seriously restricting
    their activity;

33. Shares the criticism of Chinese jurists that the fundamental shortcomings of China’s legal
    code on religion reside in the constitution, since the principle of ‘religious freedom’
    provided for in clauses 1 and 2 of Article 36 conflicts with the principle of ‘restrictions on
    religion’ provided for in clauses 3 and 4, with no clarification as to which takes precedence;
    joins the call by Chinese jurists religious freedom to be established as the principle of
    precedence in the constitution;

34. Acknowledges efforts made in the area of controlling and carefully applying the death
    penalty in China, but remains concerned at the fact that the Chinese Government is still
    maintaining its policy of not releasing details of the number of prisoners executed annually,
    keeping information on the death penalty a state secret; further urges the Chinese authorities
    to stop the politicised use of the death penalty and to ensure that there are procedural
    safeguards in the country’s legal system which guarantee the protection of people sentenced
    to death, including the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards;

35. Considers regrettable, as regards the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, the continuing lack
    of any substantial progress and the failure to produce concrete and visible results; recalls
    that, on the adoption of a new EU human rights strategy, EU foreign ministers pledged in
    June 2012 that the EU would now ‘raise human rights issues vigorously in all appropriate
    forms of bilateral dialogue, including at the highest level’; calls on the newly appointed EU
    Special Representative for Human Rights, the EEAS, the Council and the Commission to
    step up their efforts in order to give this process new impetus and make this dialogue more
    effective and result-oriented, including through preparatory meetings with both international
    and local civil society organisations and NGOs in the presence of the authorities of both
    sides; takes the view that such dialogue should be included in all contacts with officials
    from strategic partners such as China; stresses the importance of addressing thoroughly all
    the problems relating to human rights and the rule of law in China and in the EU; takes the
    view that EU-China summits and human rights talks should include a set of transparent
    issues to be discussed and concrete benchmarks; urges the EU’s High Representative for
    Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, to voice her concerns regarding
    human rights abuses in China and to refer publicly to the concrete cases and issues
    discussed with Chinese officials in all encounters; encourages Member States’ officials to
    follow the same lines in a coherent and coordinated manner; calls on EU companies with
    activities in China to comply with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
    Rights and urges the EU and its Member States to monitor such compliance closely;

Cross-Strait relations

36. Reiterates the EU´s one-China policy; welcomes the increasing contacts between the PRC

   and Taiwan; stresses the improvement in cross-Strait relations, although they are still being
   seriously undermined by Chinese missiles aimed at Taiwan and by China’s international
   isolation of Taiwan; supports Taiwan’s meaningful participation in international
   organisations, as endorsed by Council Declaration 9486/09 of 8 May 2009;

37. Is pleased at the great interest taken by millions of Chinese citizens in the presidential and
    parliamentary elections in Taiwan on 14 January 2012, which could be followed instantly
    on the internet for the first time;

38. Salutes the strong and flourishing cross-Strait economic ties, as well as the new opening-up
    of Taiwan to Chinese tourists and cultural cooperation; considers the internationalisation of
    trade and investment to be the best guarantor of Taiwan’s stability; urges Taiwan’s
    government, therefore, to accompany its investment in the PRC with investments
    elsewhere;

External situation

39. Urges the PRC to use its global position in a more responsible way, in particular in the
    United Nations Security Council (UNSC), where it holds a permanent seat and a right of
    veto; stresses, in this connection, the need for China to abandon its veto position on any
    UNSC resolution allowing intervention in Syria in order to halt the civil war and to enable
    the Syrian people to take the future of their country into their hands, as part of a democratic
    and free process; stresses that China should also act in a responsible manner that is
    commensurate with its global contribution, at G20 level to deal with the world financial
    crisis, by aligning itself with World Trade Organisation rules, and by observing all
    international conventions and treaties to which it is a party;

40. Urges the PRC unequivocally to commit itself to observing the UN Charter and
    international law in the pursuit of its goals abroad;

41. Appreciates that China is the biggest contributor of peacekeeping troops among the
    permanent members of the UNSC, thanks mostly to its rapidly modernising navy;
    welcomes, in this connection, the increased cooperation with the EU in the fight against
    piracy in the Gulf of Aden; calls on China, as a permanent UNSC member, to cooperate in a
    responsible way with the international community on important global security concerns,
    such as the situation in Syria and Iran;

42. Recognises China’s responsibility both to provide security to its citizens and to assume a
    role in promoting peace and stability in the world, and welcomes its increased participation
    in the UN; calls, however, for the Chinese side to show more transparency and cooperate
    more closely with the EU and the UN on these issues, and for it to avoid isolation in the
    development of its foreign policy;

43. Calls on China to review its policy of ‘non-interference in countries’ internal affairs’ in
    cases of severe breaches of international humanitarian law;

44. Welcomes the EU-China dialogue initiated in July 2012 on the Common Security and
    Defence Policy; proposes that this dialogue be extended to include the entire Asia-Pacific
    region;

45. Asks China to dispel growing international concerns about its non-transparent military

   budget;

46. Underlines the global importance of the South China Sea, through which one third of the
    world’s trade passes; is alarmed at the escalating tension and therefore urgently appeals to
    all the parties involved to refrain from unilateral political and military actions, to tone down
    statements and to settle their conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea by means
    of international arbitration in accordance with international law, in particular the UN
    Convention on the Law of the Sea, in order to ensure regional stability;

47. Is seriously worried about the escalating tensions between China and Japan; appeals
    strongly to China and Japan to combat perceptions of one another as mutual enemies, and
    considers regrettable their failure to use the 40th anniversary of their diplomatic relations
    for constructive negotiations;

48. Calls, in view of the European Union’s significant interests in the security and stability of
    East Asia, on all parties concerned (China, Japan and Taiwan) to demonstrate restraint and
    to take steps to calm the situation on the disputed islands; urges all parties concerned to
    settle disputes peacefully in a spirit of cooperation and in compliance with international law,
    in particular the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and agree on de-escalating
    measures of engagement in the event of unforeseen incidents;

49. Takes note of Taiwan’s initiative with a view to reaching a consensus on a code of conduct
    for the East China Sea and the establishment of a mechanism allowing all sides to cooperate
    in the joint exploitation of the region’s natural resources, including capacity for the
    generation of electricity from renewable sources;

50. Notes that China’s role in the cooperation between the two parties on the Korean Peninsula
    is vital and calls on the PRC more actively to seek enhanced cooperation between the North
    and the South;

51. Notes, and considers it regrettable, that the survival of the dictatorial and repressive North
    Korean regime depends essentially on China; welcomes China’s responsible behaviour in
    voting in favour of the UNSC’s strong condemnation on 15 April 2012 of the failed rocket
    launch by North Korea, widely considered as an attempted ballistic missile test; looks
    forward to China continuing to take responsibility for stability on the Korean Peninsula, a
    swift resumption of the six-party talks on the North Korean nuclear threat, and, above all, a
    drastic improvement in the day-to-day living conditions of North Korean citizens brought
    about through Chinese incentives;

52. Notes China’s growing role in the Central Asian region through trade, economic and energy
    projects; considers that China can play a major role in the development of countries in
    Central Asia and calls on the PRC to promote better relations between states there as a
    pivotal step towards regional cooperation; remarks that China’s main objectives within the
    Shanghai Cooperation Organisation are to achieve peace and stability in Central Asia by
    collectively combating the so-called ‘three evils’ of extremism, separatism and terrorism;
    notes China’s great strategic and economic interest in the region through the exploitation of
    its vast oil and gas reserves and the connection of Central Asia to China’s coastline via
    railways and highways;

53. Welcomes the developing ties between China and Afghanistan, with talks taking place at a
    senior leadership level for the first time in history; considers that China can play a pivotal

   role in stabilising Afghanistan through a soft power approach and urges the development of
   close cooperation between the EU and China on this issue;

54. Observes that the new American strategy of renewed focus on Asia is perceived by the
    Chinese leadership as an attempt by the USA to contain China’s rapid economic and
    political ascension; encourages China and the USA to avoid tensions and an arms race in
    the Pacific; urges China to ensure freedom of circulation on the seas;

55. Believes that very serious consideration should be given to the economic, social and
    environmental impact of increasing investment by China in developing countries;

56. Notes that the increasing Chinese presence in Africa has contributed to economic
    development, with a particular focus on infrastructure projects; appreciates the Chinese
    leadership’s acknowledgement of the serious criticism of its imbalanced,
    raw-material-centred African policy during the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation
    (FOCAC), held in Beijing on 20 July 2012, as demonstrated by its current open promotion
    of a diversification of its activities on the African continent; welcomes the pledge by State
    and Party leader Hu Jintao at this FOCAC meeting of a record credit of USD 20 billion to
    African countries over the next three years for developing their infrastructure, agriculture,
    manufacturing and SMEs; welcomes the support expressed by China for the Extractive
    Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and encourages the Chinese authorities to follow
    the global trend towards more transparency and to increase their concrete commitments in
    this area; calls on the EU to remain vigilant about the political, economic, social and
    environmental impact of China’s growing investments in Africa;

57. Is concerned that the increasing Chinese presence in Africa has led to grave social tensions,
    but welcomes the fact that Chinese companies have expressed their willingness to place
    greater emphasis on corporate social responsibility in their African activities; urges the
    Chinese authorities to anchor their policies in Africa on the principles of, and respect for,
    human rights, the promotion of sustainable development and human security;

58. Takes note of China’s increasing involvement in the exploitation of natural resources in
    Latin America, with Chinese imports of such resources having increased by more than
    50 %;

59. Encourages China, the world’s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, to play a more proactive
    and constructive role in promoting cooperation within the global community in order to
    tackle climate change; welcomes the White Paper issued by the Chinese authorities in
    November 2011 on the policies adopted and action taken to combat climate change and
    calls for it to be implemented swiftly;

60. Notes that people-to-people contacts can play a crucial role in reaching a better mutual
    understanding both between China and the EU and between China and some of its other
    partners, such as the USA; welcomes, in this connection, the programmes intended to
    facilitate mobility between China and the EU;

61. Urges China to make it an absolute priority to ensure legal certainty for foreign companies,
    by upholding the principles of equality, reciprocity and corporate social responsibility;

                                                o

                                            o      o

62. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the EEAS, the Commission,
    the governments and parliaments of the Member States and of the accession and candidate
    countries, the Government of the People’s Republic of China, the Chinese National
    People’s Congress, the Taiwanese Government and the Taiwanese Legislative Yuan.

   Committee on Development (A7-0010/2012),

A. whereas the growing political and economic relevance of Brazil, Russia, India, China and
   South Africa (the BRICS) entails an increased relevance of these countries in foreign policy
   terms;

B. whereas the BRICS and other emerging economies could become increasingly relevant in
   foreign policy terms on the global scene if their economic growth is further consolidated;

C. whereas seven emerging countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, Indonesia, Mexico and
   Turkey) are projected to have larger economies than, collectively, the G-7 countries (USA,
   Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy) in 2050; whereas, in terms of
   gross domestic product, China is projected to become the world’s largest economy before
   2020; whereas India could become the fastest growing economy in the world before 2050;
   whereas, in 2050, China, the USA and India could together represent 50% of the world’s
   economy; whereas the EU could be of a broadly comparable scale to any of these countries
   if it acts as a single and robust political entity; whereas such a comparable scale is key to
   maintaining political leverage and being able to continue to promote universal values in the
   new multipolar system of global governance that is taking shape; whereas this should be
   done in the framework of a foreign policy approach aimed at promoting partnership,
   cooperation and shared governance based on common values;

D. whereas, with the process of consolidation of strong economic and foreign policy powers
   such as the BRICS, a multi-polar system has emerged, where global leadership is
   increasingly shared amongst several countries and regional blocs of countries; whereas such
   a multi-polar system entails a progressive shift in global economic power to the BRICS and
   other emerging economies and may further entail a shift of leadership and positive leverage
   in foreign policy terms from established powers to emerging powers; whereas the current
   economic crisis has accelerated the transition towards a multipolar system; whereas the
   emergence of new global players may prove a valuable opportunity for constructive
   partnership between the emerged powers and the emerging ones and for concerted action on
   global issues and challenges;

E. whereas transnational challenges – such as climate change, global regulatory issues, access
   to raw materials and rare earths, terrorism, the fight against non-State based radical
   movements, sustainable development, global political stability and security – will require a
   rule-based, inclusive approach based on partnership, common values, consensus, close
   consultation and cooperation with the new emerging powers, if truly shared, effective
   solutions to transnational challenges are to be found; whereas the EU could and should take
   the initiative in this respect;

F. whereas, without an inclusive new global governance system based on close consultation
   and cooperation with the BRICS and other emerging economies, there will be little
   incentive for international cooperation and concerted action on major global issues with the
   potential risk of (i) political and economic fragmentation and the emergence of competing
   world agendas and separate regional areas, (ii) the disentanglement of global economic
   structures and investment flows and (iii) the creation of regional blocs of influence with
   very limited international coordination and no possibility of concerted solutions to
   transnational challenges;

G. whereas the large demographic dimensions of the BRICS and other emerging powers,

   compared to the declining demographics of the West, will give more authority to such
   countries in international fora, as the BRICS and other emerging powers will be able to
   claim more representativeness of the vast majority of the world’s population; whereas this
   entails the need to reform the global governance system and the governance structure of
   international organisations, so that they can become more representative of the new
   economic and political landscape and continue to maintain a central role in the global
   consensus-building and decision-making processes;

H. whereas, in view of the current economic crisis and the budgetary constraints of the EU and
   the USA, there is an urgent need to pool resources with other emerging powers in order to
   ensure a coherent and efficient global security and stability architecture and effective
   intervention in sensitive areas on the basis of common objectives and coordinated strategies
   and efforts;

I. whereas a successful transition to a middle-income economy can, under certain conditions,
   foster a more moderate and stability-oriented foreign policy; whereas, however, in some
   BRICS countries and other emerging countries the consolidation of their economic and
   political power has not always given rise to such a transition;

J. whereas, in spite of the recent spectacular economic growth in most of the BRICS countries,
   these same countries are also the ones with the single largest concentration of poverty in the
   world; whereas this shows that, in the great majority of cases, without pro-poor growth and
   creation of safety nets, rapid economic growth may entail an increase in inequalities;

K. whereas the BRICS and current emerging economies do not constitute or comprise a formal
   grouping of countries designed to play a specific role in international affairs and whereas
   the EU should therefore develop a relationship with each one of those countries, taking note
   of their singularity and specific foreign policy objectives and aims; whereas the EU should
   invest in strategic partnerships with each BRICS country and other emerging economies, as
   they increasingly play a role in the international arena, particularly in international
   organisations, such as the UN, as a means of advancing common goals, namely peace and
   global security, the rule of law domestically or internationally, the promotion of human
   rights, democracy, sustainable development and global financial regulation;

L. whereas the BRICS and other emerging economies require a stable foreign policy setting
   and a stable regulatory and public policy environment, which can sustain interest and
   investment in their economies and societies; whereas the BRICS and other emerging
   economies need to invest and be supported in the consolidation of democratic, political,
   economic and social stability;

M. whereas the EU must play a major role in the global power transition as a promoter of
   partnership and inclusive governance, but needs to act fast if it wishes to maintain its
   leverage (or it could be strategically sidelined); whereas this will entail strategic changes
   both inside the EU and with regard to its foreign policy, inter alia the introduction of greater
   policy coherence;

N. whereas, at the end of their third meeting on 14 April 2011, the BRICS leaders issued a
   joint declaration calling for more international cooperation and a strengthening of global
   governance, and expressing support for multilateral diplomacy with the United Nations and
   the G-20; whereas all five BRICS countries have been concurrently present in the UN
   Security Council during 2011; whereas the BRICS have called for change in the governing

   structures of the international financial institutions and the UN to reflect the changes in the
   world economy and to better manage today's global challenges;

O. whereas the BRICS display considerable divergences in their political and economic
   systems, demographic and social trends, and foreign policy outlooks;

P. whereas the European Council conclusions of 16 September 2010 stressed that, in
   accordance with the Lisbon Treaty and in line with the European Security Strategy, the EU
   and its Member States would act more strategically so as to bring Europe's true weight to
   bear internationally and that the EU's strategic partnerships with key players in the world
   provide a useful instrument for pursuing European objectives and interests;

Q. whereas current trade agreements between the EU and the BRICS countries are not only
   mutually beneficial in economic terms but also politically beneficial to both sides;

R. whereas the EU should play a proactive part in building an inclusive and representative
   United Nations system based on partnership, that can effectively contribute to global
   governance and solutions, peace and security, democracy, human rights and a rule-of-law-
   based international order; whereas, in accordance with Article 21 of the TEU, the EU is
   formally committed to effective multilateralism with a strong UN at its core;

S. whereas over the years the EU has developed with BRICS bilateral strategic partnerships
   based on shared values and interests aimed at upgrading the relations and enhancing
   cooperation at all level; whereas these strategic partnerships have often proved to be
   inadequate with regard, in particular, to promoting democracy, strengthening the rule of law
   and defining a common approach to the resolution of conflicts;

T. whereas there is an urgent need to seek ways of strengthening cooperation within the United
   Nations system and within the groups of leading countries (G-7, G-20) and improving the
   way their work is coordinated;

U. whereas the Group of 20 (G-20), whose member countries account for 88 % of global GDP
   and 65 % of the world's population, has become an important forum for cooperation at
   global level, but the problem of its representativeness needs to be resolved and its precise
   role in the multilateral architecture determined;

1. Stresses how the current economic crisis has demonstrated the interdependence between the
   emerged powers and the BRICS and other emerging countries; points to the deep, mutual
   link between stable economic growth of developed economies and stable economic growth
   of emerging economies; emphasises the positive nature of such interdependence and the
   mutually beneficial character of political and economic ties between developed and
   emerging economies; believes that further political dialogue and understanding with the
   BRICS and other emerging countries, including on an individual basis, should thus be
   pursued by the EU and its Member States in a spirit of partnership and with the overall aim
   of achieving an inclusive new system of governance; believes, furthermore, that regular
   high-level meetings between the EU and individual BRICS countries would provide a
   valuable opportunity to build relations of trust, reconcile positions and encourage BRICS
   countries to assume greater responsibility in a new system of global governance, based on
   shared responsibility, common approaches and more closely coordinated actions; expresses
   the view that the instrument of strategic partnerships could provide valuable synergies in
   achieving such objectives;

2. Believes that relations between, on the one hand, the established powers and, on the other,
   the BRICS and other emerging powers maintain a relevant economic dimension, but are
   essentially political and should thus be politically framed, as all the countries concerned
   share an interest in ensuring an effective system of global governance and in tackling
   together, in a spirit of cooperation and consultation, and convergence of policy stances,
   those global stability and security risks which may pose a threat to sustainable global
   economic growth and its potential for the future; calls, therefore, for enhanced cooperation
   between the EU and the BRICS, including in terms of partnerships with individual BRICS
   countries, on all matters of international concern;

3. Stresses that whilst the BRICS may hold similar stances in foreign policy terms, major
   differences characterise them in political, economic and social terms; points out, in
   particular, that their political systems vary from strong authoritarian regimes to credible and
   stable democracies; calls, in this respect, on the EU to step up relations and develop
   synergies, in particular, with those BRICS that genuinely share and respect democratic
   values and strive for a social market economy;

4. Believes that, with the emergence of new economic and foreign policy powers, the EU will
   not see its leverage reduced but has an important role to play in promoting a common
   understanding on policy choices and should show leadership in tackling global challenges;
   takes the view that the EU and its transatlantic partners should focus on achieving the
   necessary economies of scale and develop concerted efforts to enable them to interact with
   the emerging powers constructively and effectively both in a bilateral and multilateral
   fashion, and in a spirit of true partnership and good cooperation; points to the need to
   develop an inclusive system of global governance, based on cooperation and coordination
   with the BRICS and other emerging countries, as appropriate, for the benefit of all; points
   further to the key role of the EU and its transatlantic partners in promoting an inclusive
   system of global governance; stresses that the EU should act more strategically so as to
   bring Europe's true weight to bear internationally, in particular by managing the
   implications of interdependence, instigating reforms of global governance, and mobilising
   collective action in areas such as the rule of law, sustainable environment and regional
   security, through constructive interaction with the BRICS and other emerging powers;

5. Welcomes the concept of bilateral strategic partnerships and urges the Council and the
   EEAS to operationalise it; considers strategic partnerships to be a promising and potentially
   transformative tool for organising and advancing the EU’s relations with key players in the
   global arena, including the BRICS and other emerging powers; recommends that this
   instrument be used by the EU to pursue both multilateral and bilateral agendas and to
   develop meaningful linkages between the two; underlines that internal coherence is vital for
   the EU to act and be perceived as a genuine strategic interlocutor with the BRICS and other
   emerging powers;

6. Notes that in the past the BRICS have appeared to coordinate their stances in foreign policy
   terms in the UN Security Council in certain instances, most notably at the onset of the
   Libyan and Syrian crises and, additionally, by deferring the vote on the role of the EU in the
   UNGA and by adopting coinciding positions on Côte d'Ivoire and Sudan; points out in this
   regard that the BRICS may seem to be challenging the current system of international
   governance, but that democratic dialogue, political engagement, including on an individual
   basis, and true partnership may bring to the fore positive synergies and facilitate a new
   inclusive system of global governance; believes that the EU should duly take into account

   the new weight, in political and economic terms, of the BRICS and other emerging powers,
   as this may contribute to an orderly reform of global governance, based on a convergent
   platform without any destabilising effects;

7. Notes that BRICS have shown regional integration capacity and hence the capacity to
   engage in multipolar governance systems; believes that this demonstrates further the
   potential interest of the BRICS in contributing to global governance; takes the view,
   therefore, that the BRICS and other emerging countries are in the process of defining their
   strategic direction in foreign policy terms and thus becoming partners of emerged powers
   and supporters of a global governance system based on universal values, partnership and
   inclusiveness;

8. Believes that, in light of their political and economic interests and their scale, regional role
   and aspirations, the BRICS may attempt to act as a group in foreign policy terms, but
   acknowledges that individual dimensions are also relevant; considers, in this connection,
   that besides focusing on the BRICS as a potentially cohesive group of States in foreign
   policy terms, the EU should focus also on the BRICS on a country-by-country basis, whilst
   maintaining a systemic and coordinated approach; takes the view, in this regard, that such
   an approach will enable the EU to build up economies of scale through partnerships with
   individual BRICS, maximise its interests and role in the various regions and contribute to
   the consolidation of a multipolar order with a political and economic balance between
   emerged and emerging economies, on the basis of an inclusive system based on dialogue,
   partnership and bilateral or multilateral partnerships;

9. Believes further that the considerable divergences in the political and economic systems,
   demographic and social trends, and foreign policy outlooks of the BRICS should inform,
   and be reflected in, a nuanced EU policy towards these countries aimed at creating
   synergies with individual BRICS countries and other emerging countries and at
   discouraging the creation or consolidation of potentially cohesive alternative groups of
   States in foreign policy terms; urges the EU and its Member States, in this context, to
   discourage the entrenchment of and strategic competition between blocs of emerged and
   emerging powers, respectively; contends that, in order to promote international collective
   action and the reform of global governance, the EU must leverage a diverse range of
   bilateral, multilateral and non-state interactions, and harness issue-based coalitions that cut
   across the emerged/emerging world divide;

10. Believes that the EU should formulate its position regarding a closer relationship with the
    BRICS, even taking into account the fact that the EU’s vision and the BRICS countries’
    vision with regard to binding commitments and institutionalised regimes may not
    necessarily always be the same; believes also that support from the BRICS countries for
    effective multilateralism might be gained in exchange for stronger representation in relevant
    international institutions; insists that the challenges posed by the rise of the BRICS should
    be seen as an opportunity rather than a problem;

11. Takes the view that relations with the BRICS countries should be built upon bilateral
    dialogues focusing on and fostering further democratisation and the consolidation of the
    rule of law, good governance, regulatory convergence, coordination of common positions in
    international fora and intensified relations with the EU;

12. Underscores the importance of Brazil as a leading power of the MERCOSUR regional
    integration process; welcomes the renewed EU-Brazil Strategic Partnership Joint Action

   Plan 2012-2014, and the mutual commitments made in the areas of democracy promotion
   and reforms of the multilateral system of governance; urges both sides to honour their
   commitments and contribute to the reform of the world's financial architecture; recalls the
   offer made by President Rousseff regarding support for the EU to overcome its sovereign-
   debt crisis, and acknowledges the interrelation between both; expresses its support for a
   balanced and fair conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda and the EU-MERCOSUR
   Association Agreement, which will be the most important association agreement ever
   signed by the EU, encompassing 750 million people and trade worth USD 125 billion a
   year; takes note of Brazil's request to have full visa liberalisation and asks the Commission
   to present a proposal in this regard;

13. Highlights the indispensable role of the EU-Russia strategic partnership in maintaining
    peace and security in Europe, enhancing trade and economic development, preserving
    energy security, and addressing transnational challenges; considers that, in the long-term,
    the rise of Asian powers is likely to facilitate further alignment of interests and closer
    strategic cooperation between the EU and Russia; believes that such cooperation is vital for
    progress on issues of global importance, such as nuclear proliferation, terrorism, climate
    change or illegal migration;

14. Highlights the importance and potential of the EU-India strategic partnership; considers
    that, in the current global economic crisis, issues such as the social crisis, climate change,
    migration flows and global security should be addressed in a more comprehensive
    partnership between India and the EU; notes also that the ongoing free-trade agreement
    negotiations are reinforcing EU-India relations: considers, however, that this relationship
    should not be limited to trade issues; would welcome the re-establishment of a counterpart
    grouping to the European Parliament Delegation for relations with India ,following the
    experience of the India-Europe Friendship Group, which existed in the Indian Parliament
    before its 2009 elections;

15. Underscores the importance of China as a major economic power and highlights its
    essential role in global economic recovery; recalls, in this connection, the need for China to
    meet its agreed WTO obligations, ten years after its accession; calls on the EU and its
    Member States and China, furthermore, to tackle common challenges and threats to
    international peace and security, in particular through improved cooperation on a diplomatic
    solution to Iran's nuclear crisis; urges both sides to foster more balanced trade between
    them, notably by stepping up their efforts to conclude negotiations on a new partnership and
    cooperation agreement, in order for this framework to fulfil the potential of the EU-China
    strategic partnership;

16. Underscores the strategic nature of EU-South Africa relations; welcomes the positive
    outcome of the fourth EU-Africa summit of September 2011, in particular the convergence
    of views on the situation in Libya; urges the EU and South Africa to conclude, as soon as
    possible, negotiations on a new Economic and Partnership Agreement; contends that South
    Africa, given its record of successful and peaceful transition to democracy and its role as a
    regional power, can be a major force in promoting democracy and good governance,
    fostering regional economic integration, and supporting national reconciliation across
    Africa, and a key partner for the EU in these efforts; stresses the importance of close
    cooperation between the EU and South Africa on climate change, sustainable development
    and reforms of international institutions;

17. Believes that, in light of the increasing relevance of the BRICS and other emerging powers
    and the multipolar system of global governance that is taking shape, the G-20 could prove a
    useful and particularly appropriate forum for consensus building and for a decision-making
    process which is inclusive, based on partnership and able to foster convergence, including
    regulatory convergence; takes the view that, notwithstanding the increasing relevance of the
    G-20, the G-7 could play a key role as a consultative, coordinating and consensus-building
    forum for the established powers with a view to dialogue with the BRICS and other
    emerging powers, and ahead of G-20 meetings; considers that the existence of the G-8
    should also be harnessed in an effort to reconcile positions with Russia so that common
    challenges can be addressed in a coordinated and effective manner; supports the G-20
    parliamentary dimension and believes that it should be further consolidated and involved in
    the decision-making processes to ensure reinforced democratic dialogue and scrutiny;
    supports also the creation of a parallel G-20 consultative forum bringing together non-
    governmental organisations and leading representatives of civil society and business from
    G-20 states;

18. Believes that the current sovereign debt crisis will be an important test for the G-20 as an
    effective forum for strategic political dialogue able to promote a truly global system of
    economic and financial governance reflecting the interdependence between developed
    economies and emerging ones, creating the foundations for the elimination of systemic
    unbalances which can be particularly damaging both for developed economies and, in a
    longer-term perspective, emerging ones, and promoting solidarity in international financial
    fora such as the International Monetary Fund;

19. Calls on the EU to enhance political dialogue and cooperation with the BRICS to push
    further forward the reform of global financial and economic governance institutions, i.e. the
    Bretton Woods institutions, with the aim of ensuring the broad representation of all member
    countries while reflecting changes in economic weight;

20. Considers that the emerged powers should support regional organisations which include the
    BRICS and other emerging countries, such as ASEAN or Mercosur, including their
    institution-building and capacity-building processes, and ensure a high-level diplomatic
    presence at meetings of such organisations;

21. Notes that, given the increasing global and regional relevance of China, India and other
    emerging countries in Asia, both the United States of America and the EU may
    progressively shift their primary attention, political investment and resources to the Pacific
    and perceive the North Atlantic dimension and mutual cooperation as less strategic; further
    notes that Asia should play a more important role on the foreign agenda of the European
    Union and EU Member States; calls for more coordination of the US and EU policies
    towards China, India and other emerging countries in Asia in order to avoid a decoupling
    of such policies; strongly believes that by coordinating their efforts the USA and the EU
    will attain the required political synergies to engage in an effective positive and constructive
    dialogue with the BRICS and other emerging countries; takes the view that, without
    prejudice to the G-7, regular EU-US summits would provide the opportunity to identify
    common objectives and coordinate strategies on matters of global relevance, including
    economic governance, in order to reach a common approach towards the emerging powers;
    recalls that transatlantic relations are of utmost importance both economically and
    politically and stresses the mutual strong economic relationship between the United States
    of America and the EU; considers that the Transatlantic Economic Council and the

   Transatlantic Legislators’ Dialogue could also offer an opportunity for dialogue and stock-
   taking and should thus include a reflection on strategic engagement by the EU and the US
   of the BRICS and other relevant emerging countries and on how to foster regulatory
   convergence with such countries; recalls the need to set up a Transatlantic Political Council
   as an ad-hoc body for systematic, high-level consultation and coordination on foreign and
   security policy between the EU and the US;

22. Stresses that for issues of global reach or related to global governance the EU, rather than
    its Member States, should be the interlocutor of emerged powers, the BRICS and other
    emerging countries; believes that, with a view to achieving a coherent policy stance towards
    the BRICS and other emerging powers, it is of fundamental importance that Member States
    develop their bilateral relations with maximum transparency and bearing in mind the
    potential impact of such relations on EU policies and stances; believes that the EU should
    strive to achieve more political and economic cohesion and growth in order to maintain
    political leverage and a key role in the multipolar system that is taking shape and be
    perceived as a necessary valuable counterpart by the BRICS and the new emerging
    countries;

23. Stresses that the overall coordination of EU foreign policy towards the BRICS and other
    emerging powers should be ensured by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign
    Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission in accordance with Articles
    18(4) and 21(3) TEU; believes that the EU should strive to achieve, under the coordination
    of the High Representative, a better linking of foreign and security policy with EU sectoral
    policies, such as development, energy security, trade, access to raw materials and rare
    earths, climate change and migration, with a view to exploiting synergies and ensuring a
    coherent and systemic foreign policy approach aiming at universal respect for the rule of
    law, human rights and democratic governance; considers that the concept of EU ‘strategic
    partners’ should be further upgraded and better equipped to reflect such fundamental
    objectives; points to the conclusions of the COP 17 to the United Nations Framework
    Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and stresses the continued need for a coherent
    and coordinated effort with the BRICS to reach a progressive agreement;

24. Takes the view that a coherent foreign policy approach at EU level also entails enhanced
    coordination between the President of the European Council, the High Representative, the
    Council, Parliament and the Commission on issues related to the agendas of the G-7, G-8
    and G-20;

25. Notes that the EU should have capacity to adjust and reform its internal governance
    structures in order to ensure a decision-making process able to reflect its plurality and create
    consensus; stresses the importance that a coherent foreign policy approach at EU level
    towards the BRICS and other emerging countries be reflected in the functioning of the
    EEAS; believes that the EEAS should review and strengthen strategic partnerships with
    individual BRICS countries, in close consultation with Parliament, exploiting their
    specificities and the potential for synergies and cooperation with the EU; urges the EEAS to
    devise horizontal and vertical coordination mechanisms that will enable EU foreign policy
    to benefit from EU institutional synergies and from the density and depth of Member States'
    bilateral ties with strategic partners, including the BRICS and other emerging powers; takes
    the view that, with regard to the BRICS, in addition to its organisation along geographical
    and thematic lines, the EEAS should establish an ad hoc coordinating mechanism to ensure
    that all individual policies towards the BRICS are compatible from a systemic point of view

   and that the policy lines adopted are reflected in the EU dialogue with emerged powers such
   as the USA, Canada and Japan; believes that the EU delegations in BRICS countries and
   other relevant emerging powers should liaise more closely with one another in order to
   ensure continuous monitoring and analysis on relations amongst the BRICS and relevant
   cross-sensitivities, thus enabling a more systemic approach; takes the view in this regard
   that EU Delegations in BRICS countries should analyse the positions of BRICS countries
   on governance and global challenges and on relations with other BRICS countries; believes
   that the EU should direct renewed efforts and resources to leading the reform process of a
   global system of governance and of international organisations with a view to ensuring a
   more inclusive consensus-building and decision-making process at global level, in
   particular the reform of the UN Security Council and global financial multilateralism;

26. Believes that ‘effective multilateralism’ and greater coordination in multilateral fora to
    address global governance issues should remain the core of enhanced partnership with the
    BRICS countries; recommends, in particular, that the EU pursue its efforts to engage these
    countries on this line;

27. Believes that Parliament should participate in the bilateral summits between the EU and its
    strategic partners;

28. Believes that the staff of EU Delegations in BRICS countries should include Parliament
    liaison officers in order to foster a greater understanding of the national parliamentary
    dimension in each of those countries, promote closer cooperation and dialogue between the
    European Parliament and national parliaments on a bilateral basis and promote more
    democratic accountability of the decision-making processes in international fora such as the
    G-8 and the G-20; believes that, in addition to its existing delegations for relations with
    Russia, India, China and South Africa respectively, a delegation for relations with Brazil
    could also be considered;

29. Believes that, with a view to ensuring effective democratic scrutiny of EU policy-making
    towards the BRICS and other emerging countries, and in order to facilitate an enhanced
    interparliamentary dialogue with such countries, relevant Parliament staff should develop
    specialised competence and thus have appropriate analytical tools and monitoring capacity
    and be able to assist Members in promoting effective dialogue; believes also that a system
    of staff exchanges between Parliament and the EEAS should be put in place to maximise
    synergies, interinstitutional dialogue and cooperation and promote the exchange of
    expertise;

30. Stresses that any deepening of relations and strengthening of political cooperation with
    BRICS at governmental level should go along with a sustained dialogue between civil
    society organisations; calls on the EEAS and EU delegations, in this connection, to create
    the framework to facilitate and step up people-to-people contacts and cultural and academic
    exchanges based on existing and ad hoc programmes with a view to improving mutual
    understanding and developing common actions and initiatives;

31. Insists on the need to upgrade political dialogue with the BRICS countries on observance of
    human rights and social and environmental standards; recalls in this respect that the
    observance of core labour standards (CLS) and the ILO’s decent work agenda is essential in
    achieving the MDGs as guaranteeing socio-political stability and raising the skill levels of a
    country’s workforce has a positive impact on the economy of a country;

32. Welcomes the aforementioned Commission Communication on ‘A Budget for Europe
    2020’, which draws up a proposal for the design of financial instruments and programmes
    under the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020; underlines that the new
    partnership instrument aimed at supporting EU political and economic interests in the rest
    of the world and including non-ODA-eligible activities should be a foreign policy
    instrument; believes that such a partnership instrument could help consolidate stronger
    political ties and thereby stronger economic ties with select countries, and welcomes the
    promotion of regulatory convergence as one of its aims; believes also that the Partnership
    Instrument should comprise financing lines for public diplomacy with a view to
    consolidating the relations of individual countries with the EU and fostering leverage,
    partnership and allegiance; takes the view, however, that provision should also be made for
    additional resources supporting democratisation, the consolidation of the rule of law, better
    education and the reduction of social disparities; believes that the new design of financial
    instruments and programmes should give particular relevance to ad hoc financing lines
    supporting emerging powers and potentially emerging powers in consolidating democratic
    structures and developing good governance and the rule of law, civil society organisations,
    good educational systems and progressive social inclusion; welcomes the proposal by the
    Commission to include the principle of conditionality in all EU programmes and
    instruments and believes that this is key to achieving more leverage in promoting human
    rights, democracy and good governance as universal values;

33. Calls on the BRICS countries to take on a role in international development policy that
    better reflects their share in global GDP;

34. Urges the EU and the Member States to support South-South cooperation initiatives and to
    take part in triangular cooperation projects in which the BRICS are participating;

35. Considers it extremely important to encourage more EU cooperation with the BRICS and
    other emerging economies in the system of global governance and in international
    organisations; believes that the EU and the US should enter a strategic dialogue with the
    BRICS on the reform options of international organisations; considers that a reflection
    should be furthered at EU level on how to maximise the role, voice and voting power of the
    EU in international fora and achieve a more streamlined coordination amongst EU Member
    States in such fora and thereby a more cohesive stance with a view to positive dialogue,
    partnership and cooperation with the BRICS;

36. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the President of the European Council,
    the President of the Commission, the Vice-President of the Commission/High
    Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the Council, the Polish
    Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Commission, and the US State
    Department.

A. whereas China joined the WTO in 2001 and has subsequently become the world’s leading
   exporter of goods, accounting for 10,36 % of exports in 2010 and the world’s second largest
   economic power;

B. whereas the EU is the top destination for Chinese exports, which rose by 39,5 %
   between 2009 and 2010, and whereas China is the EU’s second-largest trading partner;

C. whereas the EU has replaced Japan as China’s largest source of import; whereas growing
   Chinese imports have been crucial for the recent economic performance of export-oriented
   EU member states like Germany;

D. whereas the increased development of its economy and its accession to the WTO entail not
   only substantial benefits but also a greater responsibility for China to play a full and
   positive role in the global economic order, in particular in the International Monetary Fund
   (IMF) and the World Bank Group;

E. Whereas bilateral trade relations have developed considerably since the signature of the EU-
   China cooperation agreement in 1985, and it is therefore essential that this agreement is
   brought into line with the current economic situation; whereas the European Commission
   adopted its major policy strategy on China in 2006 and, under this framework, entered in
   January 2007 into negotiations on a comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation Agreement
   with the aim to further improve relations between the EU and China in the fields of trade
   and investment;

F. whereas trade between EU and China has been growing rapidly and continuously in the last
   three decades, reaching a peak amount of total trade of EUR 395 billion in 2010, and
   whereas the imbalance in bilateral trade has been in China’s favour since 1997, this trade
   deficit amounted to EUR 168,8 billion in 2010 compared to EUR 49 billion in 2000; while
   the value added to Chinese exports is very limited once the value of components imported
   from the EU and elsewhere is discounted; whereas foreign companies established in China
   account for nearly 85 % of all export trade deriving from assembly operations;

G. whereas foreign investment by the EU in China in 2010 amounted to EUR 4,9 billion and
   foreign investment by China in the EU in the same year amounted to EUR 0,9 billion;

H. whereas the divergent social, economic, and democratic models in China and in the EU, as
   well as their respective demographics and natural resources, play a large role in the trade
   imbalances between the two regions;

I. whereas the challenge posed by China is more industrial than commercial, and requires
   Europe to implement an ambitious Europe-wide industrial policy, given that purely national
   approaches do not permit a cohesive Community approach towards China;

J. whereas the shift of production of numerous consumer goods to China has eliminated many
   jobs in the European Union; whereas this shift was also accompanied by drastic price
   reductions which made many of these consumer goods affordable for European Union low-
   income households, and has contributed to a relatively low inflation environment;

K. whereas the participants of the last United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban
   did not reach a binding agreement, and whereas the commitments made by some countries
   to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions are not sufficient, given the urgency to limit the
   increase in temperatures to two degrees during the 21st century if the climate change agenda
   is to be met;

L. whereas economic growth in Europe is estimated to be much weaker than the growth in

   China, which is expected to reach around 9 % in 2012;

M. whereas the type of internal economic imbalances that are affecting the European
   economies are growing in the Chinese economy as well, not least in the real estate sector, as
   exemplified by the recent housing bubble;

N. Whereas the impact of the EU Common Commercial Policy is sometimes undermined by
   the diverging national interests pursued by Member States towards China;

O. whereas the social costs of the current economic crisis are high; whereas the employment
   rate in the EU has dropped by 1,8 % and, consequently, 9,6 % of the economically active
   population (23 million people) are unemployed, the youth unemployment rate is 21 %,
   prospects for employment levels to recover remain uncertain and 17 % of EU citizens risk
   falling into poverty;

P. whereas China, having acceded to the WTO in 2001, should respect WTO rules by
   liberalising its trade and opening its market; whereas so far its efforts in this regard have not
   been satisfactory by any means;

Q. whereas China’s accession to the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) should be
   eased through a broadening of the scope of the GPA’s rules by means of a revision, as
   agreed at the last WTO Ministerial Conference on 15 December 2011;

R. whereas the efforts of European enterprises to access the Chinese market are hindered by
   the Chinese Government’s interventionist industrial policies, the inadequate protection of
   intellectual property, a system of rules that is as ambiguous in substance as in its
   application, and by other non-tariff and technical barriers to trade;

S. whereas the undervaluation of the yuan continues to create artificial trade advantages for
   China, and whereas G20 member countries have promised to facilitate greater exchange rate
   flexibility;

T. whereas in 2010, over 103 million items of goods, valued in total to EUR 1,11 billion, were
   seized at the EU’s external borders on suspicion of infringing intellectual property rights
   (IPR); whereas China is the country of origin for 85 % of these goods; whereas an important
   feature of intellectual property protection is the correct enforcement of existing laws and
   international commitments, including statutes on penalties; whereas such goods are
   frequently produced in facilities that also produce legitimately labelled goods, and are often
   produced in disregard of both labour law and health and safety requirements and thus pose a
   danger to consumers and, in the case of chemicals, to the wider environment;

U. whereas China, in accordance with its 12th five-year plan, some goals of which are similar
   to goals presented in the EU 2020 Strategy, is to develop the strategic sectors of energy,
   construction and transport, and will have major needs in the service sector; whereas this
   could provide new investment opportunities for European businesses and for enhanced co-
   operation;

Improving market access

1. Calls on the Commission to apply the principle of reciprocity to the EU’s common trade
   policy with developed and emerging countries such as China, in order to restore fair

   competition and to ensure a more level playing field.

2. Welcomes the strengthening of economic relations between the European Union and China;
   calls on the EU and on China to pursue a relationship of partnership and mutual benefits
   rather than engage in fierce competition and confrontation;

3. Notes that the Chinese economy does not fulfil the criteria of a market economy as defined
   by the WTO; calls on the Commission to cooperate with the Chinese Government in order
   to eliminate all remaining obstacles by 2016, when market economy status is supposed to be
   granted China by the WTO; emphasises that this status should only be accorded prior to this
   date if China has fulfilled all criteria; asks the EU to carry out regular assessments in the
   form of annual reports on China’s compliance with the obligations included in its protocol
   on accession to the WTO;

4. While recognising that the objective conditions for China qualifying for market economy
   status are unlikely to be met in the near future, calls on the Commission to submit, by the
   end of 2012, a proposal to the European Parliament on the measures to be taken by the
   Commission before such status is recognised by the EU;

5. Regrets the existence of numerous tariff and non-tariff barriers to the Chinese market, such
   as certain forms of discrimination against foreign operators, particularly in the banking,
   insurance and telecommunications sectors, and the complexity of the tariff structure and
   technical barriers to trade, such as the lack of transparency in technical rules and conformity
   assessment procedures as well as in the Chinese Compulsory Certification System (CCC);
   regrets that China, contrary to the provisions of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and
   Countervailing Measures (ASCM), does not systematically give notification of specific
   subsidies;

6. Points out that China has established very considerable trade advantages for itself in relation
   to the EU through targeted state subsidies, using a great variety of legal constructs; urges
   China to bring its state subsidy programmes into line with relevant WTO law; further calls
   on the Commission to reform the anti-subsidy regulation in order for the EU to be able to
   respond effectively to the considerable challenges presented by China;

7. Notes that China deplores the existence of trade barriers to the European market, such as the
   EU’s significant agricultural subsidies for European farmers, the complex system of
   agricultural tariffs, the technical obstacles to trade and the barriers erected to block third
   country investments in certain Member States;

8. Is concerned by the unreliability of the judicial system, which fails to enforce contractual
   obligations, and by the lack of transparency and uniformity in applying the regulatory
   regime governing investments;

9. Is concerned by the lack of predictability and publicity in connection with the technical
   rules and standards applicable to products, particularly in relation to certification, creating
   significant trade barriers for businesses exporting to China;

10. Calls on China to adopt international standards for products and services so as to promote
    increased trade between China and other countries; welcomes the fact that China is
    increasing its involvement in international standard-setting bodies, and believes that it must
    be encouraged to do so through reciprocated EU involvement in the bodies which lay down

   Chinese standards; stresses the importance of compliance by Chinese imports with
   European standards for food and non-food products;

11. Is concerned by the fact that foreign businesses face difficulties in accessing Chinese public
    procurement, which stands in contrast to the fact that access to European public
    procurement is guaranteed; is concerned by the possibly unfair terms of competition that
    apply whereby, in particular, disguised state aid allows Chinese businesses to make
    markedly better offers than their European competitors; welcomes the revision – and
    broadened scope – of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) that was agreed
    on during the last WTO Ministerial Conference on 15 December 2011, and the
    commitments made by China on that occasion, even though they are still insufficient;
    encourages, therefore, China to offer to join the agreement on terms comparable with those
    of other parties to the Agreement, in line with its commitment in its protocol on accession to
    the WTO; calls on the Commission rapidly to develop, if possible in 2012, a European
    instrument to ensure reciprocity as regards openness in public procurement markets;
    considers that it is also crucial to reinforce instruments aimed at encouraging, coordinating
    and supporting market access for European SMEs on priority markets such as China;

12. Notes that the export credits granted by the Chinese authorities and banks promote trade
    distortions; calls on China, therefore, to comply with the OECD Arrangement on Guidelines
    for Officially Supported Export Credits; calls on the Commission to support OECD efforts
    to involve China in this Arrangement; in addition, encourages China to become a signatory
    to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention;

13. Points out that the main form in which foreign companies are allowed to set up in China is
    through joint ventures – a mechanism which is very restrictive and too often associated with
    strategic technology transfers that may favour the competitive development of China to the
    detriment of European industry in fields in which the EU is at the forefront; is convinced
    that further openness by China on the joint venture mechanism, combined with better
    protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), would benefit both sides, and would favour
    greater access for European businesses to the Chinese market;

14. Calls on the EU, in the event of China engaging in illegal trade practices, to make wherever
    use necessary of such trade defence instruments as are consistent with WTO rules, such as
    anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures, and to also make greater use of the
    WTO dispute settlement mechanism in order to ensure a level playing field for EU-China
    trade; is concerned by China’s increasing use of anti-dumping measures targeting EU
    exports as well as price dumping measures and state subsidies; invites, therefore, China to
    ensure that its anti-dumping measures are consistent with WTO rules;

Defending the interests of European industry

15. Deplores the inadequate protection of IPR in China, and regrets the lack of specific means
    available to European businesses, and particularly SMEs, to counter IPR infringements
    effectively; welcomes the Commission’s decision to propose a review of the directive on
    the enforcement of IPR; calls on the Commission and Member States to defend IPR better
    in all multilateral organisations where China is a member (the WTO, the World Health
    Organisation(WHO) and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)); wants
    China to continue to transpose into its national legislation current international law on the
    protection of IPR and, more specifically, to combat counterfeiting and piracy, and urges the
    Chinese authorities to ensure enforcement, especially at a regional level; regrets that China

   has not taken part in the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA);
   urges the Commission and the Member States to step up customs cooperation in the EU and
   with third countries, particularly with China, on the seizure of counterfeit goods, and to
   simplify customs procedures; asks the Commission and the Member States to cooperate
   more closely with third countries on copyright issues and licensing;

16. Is convinced that better protection of intellectual property rights and effective
    implementation of related rules in China would greatly promote the EU’s and other foreign
    investors’ objective of investing, sharing new technological capabilities and updating
    existing technologies in that country;

17. Notes that China produces 97 % of the rare earths used in the world and calls on it to
    guarantee its trading partners sustainable production methods and fair market access; calls
    on the Commission to pay particular attention to any potential restrictions by China on the
    export of its raw materials; recalls in this context the WTO ruling against China of
    5 July 2011, upheld on appeal, for having placed restrictions on the export of certain raw
    materials; calls on the Commission to develop a European strategy for the proper
    management of raw materials, involving increased energy efficiency, recycling, more
    efficient use of resources and the development of industrial cooperation in the green
    economy growth and innovation sectors; calls for negotiations aimed at adopting common
    rules and principles on trade in raw materials, thereby creating a framework for the use of
    export restrictions at the WTO as well at the G20, as this issue mainly concerns
    industrialised countries and China;

18. Urges the Commission to negotiate an ambitious and balanced EU-China investment
    agreement that seeks to create better environment for EU investors in China, and to
    guarantee transparency regarding governance of Chinese companies which invest within the
    EU whilst increasing the level of reciprocal capital flows; calls on the Council to elaborate
    its mandate for a future investment agreement with China, taking fully into account
    Parliament’s views and positions, as set out in the resolution of 6 April 2011 on the future
    European international investment policy;

19. Welcomes the inauguration of the EU Centre for European Union Small and Medium
    Enterprises (EU SME Centre) in Beijing in November 2010, which opened its door to
    SMEs in March 2011and which provides competences on helping European SMEs to
    overcome the challenges they face when operating on the Chinese market, in particular at
    their early stages of business development; welcomes also that the Centre seeks areas of
    opportunities for EU SMEs in China and helps them with the Chinese regulatory
    environment;

20. Stresses the importance of business-to-business cooperation, and the setting up of
    partnerships between Chinese universities and EU companies, in order to enhance
    innovation in China; calls on the advantages offered by the EU Market Access Database
    which contains information for EU businesses on market access conditions, such as import
    tariffs, product requirements, trade barriers, formalities and documents and statistics;
    welcomes the activity of the European Chamber of Commerce in China;

21. Believes that the setting up, by the Commission, of a mechanism for exchanging
    information on intergovernmental agreements between Member States and third countries in
    the field of trade with China will facilitate a coherent approach to China;

Alleviating currency competition

22. Points out that China holds sovereign debt of Member States in the eurozone; stresses that
    this fact has taken on a new political dimension as a result of the serious debt problems
    within the eurozone; calls on the Commission to start discussions with the European Central
    Bank (ECB) and Member States on the creation of a coordinated system to identify which
    parties hold sovereign debt; is concerned that the EU’s negotiating capabilities in trade
    negotiations with China are being undermined by the latter’s contribution to the financial
    stabilisation of the eurozone;

23. Emphasises that the alleged undervaluation and non-convertibility of the yuan might give
    Chinese exports an unfair competitive advantage, as China holds one-third of the world’s
    foreign exchange reserves; calls for the international financial regulations applicable to –
    and the macroeconomic coordination between – G20 countries to be strengthened, as
    economic stability and global trade would otherwise be at risk; calls on China to allow the
    yuan to appreciate to reach an appropriate exchange rate; points out that it is laid down in
    the European Treaties that the EU can, in the case of unsustainable global monetary
    imbalances, adopt an exchange rate policy;

24. Calls on the Commission to encourage China to liberalise its current accounts; calls on the
    Commission to present evidence on how the fixed exchange rate regime damages EU
    competitiveness and, having done that, to consider appropriate priorities for action;

Towards a new institutional framework for EU-China trade relations

25. Calls on the Member States, using appropriate monitoring mechanisms, to ensure that
    foreign enterprises operating in the EU respect all legislation in force in the Single Market,
    including social and environmental standards, ensure the protection of patents and
    contribute to efforts promoting the sustainability of employment when they purchase
    European businesses or set up subsidiaries in the EU; asks the Commission and Member
    States to set up a body entrusted with the ex ante evaluation of foreign strategic investment,
    along the lines of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), in
    order to obtain a clear picture of businesses operating and investing in the territory of the
    EU, and to report to the parliament on a regular basis;

26. Calls on the EU to act within all appropriate international organisations, such as the WHO,
    the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations (UN), in order to
    initiate a process of reform geared at including binding social, environmental and health
    standards into the rules on the organisation of trade governed by the WTO;

27. Deplores the fragmented and uncoordinated institutional framework of the EU-China trade
    relations; calls on the Commission urgently to revise the bilateral relations organisational
    chart, to pursue better coordination and to eliminate the redundancies at the level of the
    countless working groups, dialogues and other formal – and informal – bodies active in this
    area; calls on the Member States, individual regions and municipalities to coordinate better
    their own China policies, and to take urgent steps towards reaching an operational
    consensus that further common EU objectives;

28. Asks the EU to develop a strategy to avoid compulsory technology transfers; seeks, in this
    respect, the rapid conclusion of the enhanced cooperation procedure for the Community
    Patent;

29. Demands strict compliance with European rules and standards for all goods in circulation
    on the internal market, and calls on the Commission promptly to propose a scenario in line
    with WTO rules for the gradual introduction of a trade conditionality mechanism and/or a
    set of border adjustment measures for goods originating in third countries that do not
    comply with these standards;

Assessing China’s global role

30. Emphasises China’s growing influence in the theatre of international trade; calls on the EU,
    therefore, to remain vigilant concerning the political, economic, social and environmental
    impact of increasing Chinese investment in developing countries, particularly in Africa and
    Latin America;

31. Reaffirms the need for Chinese investments in Latin America and Africa, particularly in
    Special Economic Zones (SEZ), to contribute to the economic development of the countries
    concerned, and to the development of local production chains through the use of local
    labour;

32. Is concerned that some European companies invest in China mainly because of the low cost
    of production caused by lower social, environmental and human rights standards; strongly
    recommends that the Commission and the Member States promote effective corporate
    social responsibility (CSR) practices by European companies in China, and encourage the
    dissemination and publicity of best practices of CSR initiatives; furthermore, requests that
    the Commission assesses how CSR provisions could be included in the future EU-China
    investment agreement;

33. Considers that seeing Chinese engagement in developing countries as unfair competition,
    and pursuing a conflictual, response will be unproductive for , above all, the developing
    countries themselves; emphasises that, in the best interests of developing countries as well
    as of broader global competition and growth, EU enterprises and actors seeking to compete
    with China in trade and economic relations with developing countries should work to
    present offers that are the most attractive in terms of long-term sustainability and benefit,
    including environmental, social, human rights and governance aspects;

34. Draws attention to the fact that China is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases;
    calls on the EU to propose within international organisations that ecological aspects and
    climate change targets should be included in discussions relating to international trade;
    considers that China’s economic strength and its capacity to foster technological innovation
    should be used in support of the global fight against climate change;

35. Considers that the efforts made by the Chinese authorities concerning certain basic rights in
    China, particularly social and labour rights, do not go far enough; encourages, therefore, the
    EU and China to develop a closer and more responsible strategic dialogue based on mutual
    understanding;

Reinforcing the EU to cope with global competition

36. Calls on the EU to develop an ambitious common industrial policy based on research and
    innovation that benefits from innovative financing arrangements such as project bonds and
    that supports the development of SMEs, particularly via access to public procurement, in
    order to maintain its competiveness vis-à-vis new major players in industry and research;

   calls on the EU to enhance the value of European production by providing better quality
   information to consumers, particularly through the adoption of the regulation on origin
   marking (’made-in’) of products imported into the EU.

37. Urges the EU to strengthen its economic, budgetary, fiscal and political governance to give
    it a credible and weighty voice on the international stage; calls on the Council and the
    Commission to speak with one voice in order to prevent partnerships and bilateral
    agreements weakening the EU position; urges the Commission to cooperate closely with
    Member states when defining their commercial policies and their policies towards China;
    demands that the EU implements a long-term strategy with regard to China, ensuring the
    operational coordination both between the EU institutions and between the EU and the
    Member States;

38. Emphasises the need to adopt a balanced approach towards China; calls on the Commission
    and Member States to build up extensive cooperation with China in areas of joint research
    such as product safety and human health, and to establish further scientific, technological
    and cultural exchanges;

39. Many trade issues with China concern regulatory quality and implementation in various
    areas of policy, including industrial policy, environmental policy, crisis measures, financial
    stability and consumer protection; calls for such cases to be resolved through increased
    bilateral co-operation or dispute settlement in the WTO;

                                                  o

                                              o       o

40. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.

   second largest trading partner of the European Union since 2007,
B. Whereas increased development and WTO membership entail, besides substantial benefits,
   a greater responsibility for China to play a full and positive role in the global economic
   order, including in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group,
C. Whereas, despite continued growth, bilateral trade between China and the EU, which has a
   trade deficit with China of over EUR 160 billion in 2007, remains imbalanced,
D. Whereas financial and macro-economic imbalances and the drop in internal demand and
   exports are at the root of the current global financial and economic crisis which also affects
   China,
E. Whereas access to the Chinese market is complicated due to state-led industrial policies,
   patent infringements and an ambiguous standards and compliance regime, resulting in
   technical and non tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade for EU companies,
F. Whereas EU producers of goods and services are highly competitive on world markets, and
   whereas free and fair access to the Chinese market would allow EU companies to increase
   their exports and presence in such a market, and also increase quality and services for
   Chinese consumers,
G. Whereas EU exports to China increased in 2007 by 18.7 percent with a value of EUR 231
   billion,
H. Whereas the scale of production of counterfeit and pirated goods inside China remains at an
   alarmingly high level and 60% of the counterfeit goods seized by the customs authorities of
   the European Union are produced in China; whereas production of these goods frequently
   takes place in facilities also producing goods for the regular market and in disregard of both
   labour rights and health and safety requirements, and pose a danger to consumers and, in the
   case of chemicals, to the wider environment,

General

1 Stresses that EU - China trade has expanded enormously and is the single most important
  challenge to EU trade relations;
2. Stresses that Europe's trade relations with China should be based on the principles of
   reciprocity and fair competition and trade, according to our common values and adherence
   to WTO rules, while taking into account sustainable development, respect for
   environmental limits and contribution to global goals in the prevention of climate change;
3. Takes the view that China, as one of the engines of world growth, should play its full part in
   ensuring that the global economic order develops in a sustainable and balanced way;
4. Calls on the Commission to continue the policy of engagement and dialogue with China;
   welcomes the trade-related technical assistance provided to China by the Commission;
   considers such assistance vital to support China's successful integration into the world
   economy and, in particular, in implementing its obligations and commitments in the WTO
   and improving social and environment conditions;
5. Stresses that unprecedented cooperation is needed between the European Union and China
   in order to resolve the current financial and economic crisis; considers that it is a great

   opportunity for China and the European Union together to show a sense of responsibility
   and to play their part in helping to resolve this crisis;
6. Takes the view that the development of trade relations with China must go hand in hand
   with the development of a genuine, fruitful and effective political dialogue, which covers a
   wide variety of topics; considers that human rights should be an essential and integral part
   of the relationship between the European Union and China; calls on the Commission to
   insist on the strengthening of the Human Rights Clause in negotiations with China about a
   renewed Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA);
7. Believes that today's open trading system could stimulate economic activity between China
   and developing countries to the possible benefit of both sides and could be an
   unprecedented opportunity for economic growth and for their integration into the world
   economy, on the condition that trade policies are consistent with development objectives
   and that economic growth translates into poverty reduction;
8. Encourages the Commission to pursue openness in EU trade with China; believes that the
   European Union and the Member States should continue to offer open and fair access to
   China's exports and anticipate the competitive challenge posed by China; considers that
   China should reciprocate by strengthening its commitment to economic openness and
   market reform;
9. Urges China to play an active role in the WTO, commensurate with its economic and
   trading importance in order to foster the sound development of global trade within a strong
   and transparent framework of rules;
10. Welcomes the participation of China at the G-20 Meeting held in Washington on 15
    November 2008, which should pave the way for its definitive involvement in economic and
    financial world affairs with a subsequent taking up of major responsibilities at a global
    level;
11. Underlines that protectionism cannot be Europe’s response to the growth in EU-China trade
    relations; believes that the European Union and the Member States should strive more
    urgently to make further progress on the Lisbon reform agenda in order to develop and
    consolidate areas of comparative advantage in the global economy and to foster innovation
    and vocational training;
12. Notes that a major Chinese recovery plan for growth and jobs has been presented to deal
    with the current economic crisis; emphasises that the support measures have to be
    temporary, should meet WTO rules and should not distort fair competition;
13. Welcomes investments of China's sovereign wealth fund and state owned enterprises in the
    European Union, contributing to the creation of jobs and growth and to the mutual benefit
    and balance of investment flows; recalls however the intransparency of China's financial
    markets and stresses the importance of introducing at least a code of conduct to ensure the
    transparency of China's investment operations into the EU market; calls on the European
    Union and China to keep their respective markets equally open to investment but to
    introduce transparency provisions;

Market Access

14. Welcomes the fact that since joining the WTO, a growing number of industrial sectors in

   China have been opened to foreign investors; however, is concerned that at the same time
   some sectors are restricted or prevented from accessing foreign investment and
   discriminatory measures against foreign firms were introduced -especially on cross-border
   mergers and acquisitions;
15. Considers that in China protectionist practices, excessive bureaucracy, the undervaluing of
    the Renminbi, subsidies in various forms, and the lack of a proper and agreed level of
    enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs) hinder full market access for many EU
    companies;
16. Calls on China to further open its markets for goods and services and to continue with
    economic reforms in order to establish a stable, predictable and transparent legal framework
    for EU companies, especially for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs);
17. Calls on the Commission to discuss the draft Chinese Postal Law with the Chinese
    Government for as long as this draft contains a provision that would hamper foreign express
    services; believes that a balanced regulatory framework for postal and express services is
    required in order to continue China's policy of supporting foreign investment and fair
    competition in the express delivery sector;
18. Acknowledges the steps taken by the Chinese authorities to reduce administrative burdens
    at national level and the progress in E-Government to make legislative acts available to the
    public, but notes that further progress is needed in order to secure free and equal access to
    the Chinese market for foreign companies;
19. Emphasises that further opening in terms of Chinese market access will provide
    opportunities for EU companies in numerous areas such as, machinery manufacture,
    chemicals, the automotive sector, pharmaceuticals and Information and Communication
    Technologies, Clean Development Mechanism projects, agriculture, construction and in
    financial, insurance, telecommunications and retail services;

Barriers, standards

20. Notes that NTBs represent a major obstacle for EU companies in China and for Chinese and
    non-EU companies in the European Union, particularly for SMEs;
21. Calls on China to adopt international standards for products and services with a view to
    promoting further trade between China and other countries; welcomes the fact that China is
    increasing its participation in international standard-setting bodies and believes that this
    should be encouraged and reciprocated by EU participation in China's own standard-setting
    bodies; stresses the importance of Chinese imports complying with European standards for
    food and non-food products;
Raw materials
22. Deplores the persistent use of trade-distorting export restrictions such as export taxes on
    raw materials by the Chinese Government; calls on the Commission to insist on the removal
    of all existing export restrictions in all bilateral negotiations with China; stresses that the
    removal of these export restrictions constitutes an essential element of fair trade between
    the European Union and China; underlines that it will evaluate all future trade agreements
    with China in this respect;

State aid
23. Is concerned that continued state intervention in industrial policy and explicit
    discriminatory restrictions, such as unlimited state funds for export financing and
    limitations on the level of foreign ownership in certain sectors, distort the Chinese market
    for EU companies;
Public procurement
24. Calls on China to join the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) as committed in
    2001 and to engage constructively in negotiations on opening its public procurement
    markets and, pending the successful outcome of such negotiations, to apply transparent,
    predictable and fair procedures when awarding public contracts so that foreign companies
    can participate on an equal basis; calls on China to provide immediate access to EU
    companies established and operating in China;
Currency
25. Welcomes a certain rise in the value of the Renminbi that has taken place in 2008; urges
    China to continue to let the Renminbi rise in value, so that its worth on international
    financial markets, in particular in relation to the Euro, more closely reflects China's
    economic position; urges the Chinese to hold more of their foreign exchange reserves in
    Euros;
EU presence/assistance
26. Welcomes the progress made in establishing an EU Centre in Beijing, which will help
    SMEs, and in making permanent the budget line to fund the Centre, in order to secure its
    future; stresses the need to ensure that this Centre has a clear mandate, which avoids the
    creation of double structures and leads to synergies with existing public and private
    institutions from the Member States; welcomes the work done by the IPR SME Helpdesk to
    provide information and training to EU SMEs on protecting and enforcing IPRs in China;
27. Stresses the importance of assisting in particular SMEs to overcome market access barriers;
    calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure the successful functioning of EU
    Market Access Teams in China;
Energy, sustainable energy
28. Calls on the European Union and China to take steps to promote trade in environmentally
    friendly goods and services, the growth of investment in sustainable projects and
    infrastructure and to encourage the development of industry that contributes to a reduction
    in carbon emissions;
29. Stresses the opportunities of China's emerging renewable energy sector for the European
    renewable energy business sector; calls on China to improve market access in this field;
30. Calls for enhanced cooperation between the European Union and China to promote the
    transfer of low-carbon technology, in particular energy efficiency and renewables; stresses
    the critical importance of developing and deploying carbon capture and storage in China,
    given the importance of coal to its economy; calls on the Commission to examine ways of
    supporting further the exchange of best practice with China on the issue of sustainable
    development;

Financial services
31. Expresses its concern that investment in China is still restricted for EU companies,
    especially in the banking and insurance sector, due to heavy and discriminatory licensing
    costs and rules requiring joint ventures with Chinese firms; calls on China to address
    urgently these issues;
32. Believes that deep, liquid, open, transparent and well-regulated financial markets are
    capable of fostering economic growth, considers that Chinese securities, banking and
    insurance sectors are underdeveloped, and encourages China to participate fully in the
    global debate on improving the regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial
    markets;
33. Stresses the importance of Chinese involvement and cooperation with the IMF regarding
    the development of a global code of conduct for sovereign wealth funds, which is likely to
    lead to a higher degree of transparency;
34. Calls on the Commission to evaluate, as early as possible, the impact of the financial and
    economic crisis on relevant European industry and service sectors, which play a crucial
    role in defining the export-import relationship between the European Union and China;
    requests that this evaluation be sent to Parliament as soon as a clear trend is recognisable;
Free and Fair trade

Anti dumping/market economy status

35. Considers that a permanent dialogue between trade authorities can be helpful to prevent and
    resolve trade disputes; notes, nevertheless that an effective and efficient use of trade defence
    instruments contributes to ensuring fair conditions of trade between China and the European
    Union given the rising number of anti-dumping cases filed against Chinese producers;
36. Takes the view that in many areas China's economy still does not fulfil the criteria by which
    it could be considered a market economy; calls on the Commission to work with the
    Chinese Government to overcome barriers to market economy status and to grant this status
    to China only when it has fulfilled the criteria;
IPRs and counterfeiting
37. Notes with concern that, although China has made progress in the streamlining of its
    intellectual property legislation, the effective enforcement of IPRs remains highly
    problematic;
38. Calls on China to increase its efforts to address the lack of implementation and the
    enforcement of IPRs; stresses the importance of the harmonisation of central and regional
    trade policy and regulation in China and its unified implementation throughout the country;
39. Is concerned about the scale of production of counterfeit and pirated goods inside China,
    which remains at an alarmingly high level; calls on the Commission, in cooperation with the
    Chinese authorities at national and regional level, to continue its fight against
    counterfeiting;
40. Expresses great concern about the increasing number of utility model and design patents in
    China that are often copies or minor modifications of existing European technology and do

   not contribute to real innovation;
41. Believes that, as China becomes more innovative, it is in its best interests to protect IPRs;
    believes, however, that regulations requiring the exclusive registration of innovations in
    China would heavily constrain business activities, prevent China benefiting from
    innovation and devalue the ""Made in China"" brand;
Customs
42. Welcomes the signing of a joint IPR Customs Enforcement Action Plan, aimed at enhancing
    custom cooperation on seizures of counterfeit goods and implementing concrete measures
    to reduce counterfeit sales; calls on the Commission to negotiate with China on its
    conditions in order to take part in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA);
43. Asks the Commission to intensify cooperation in the Customs Cooperation Agreement with
    the Chinese authorities aimed at trade facilitation;
44. Asks the Commission, as a follow-up to the 2005 Memorandum of Understanding on
    textiles, to continue to discuss developments in the EU -China textile trade dialogue and in
    the High Level Economic and Trade Dialogue Mechanism (HLM); calls on the Commission
    to follow closely the textiles imports originating in China;

Social and environmental impact

45. Expresses its serious concern about the high levels of pollution caused by China's industry
    and its growing consumption of natural resources, in particular those obtained from
    unsustainable sources; is aware of the shared European responsibility for the situation,
    given that a high share of Chinese industrial production is owned by European firms or
    ordered by European firms and retailers for consumption in Europe;
46. Notes that the recent years of high economic growth in China have not benefited all
    segments of the Chinese population and that the social gap between the rich and the poor
    has never been as significant as now;
47. Welcomes China’s activities in the environmental sector in the context of the preparation of
    the 2008 Olympic Games; calls upon the Chinese Government to contribute actively to the
    success of the United Nations Climate Conference (COP 15) to be held from 30 November
    to 11 December 2009 in Copenhagen by encouraging its financial sector to prepare itself for
    the introduction of an international emissions trading scheme;
48. Urges China to participate in COP 15 and accept its responsibilities by taking up its global
    share for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fighting climate change;
49. Urges the Chinese authorities to take concrete steps to adopt and encourage the use of
    technologies and practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; notes that promoting green
    business technologies will be essential if the Chinese Government wants to maintain
    economic growth while protecting its environment; recognises that China cannot be
    expected to ask its population to carry the burden of limiting greenhouse gas emissions
    without action by the West;
50. Is concerned about child labour in China; asks the Commission to address this issue as soon
    as possible and asks the Chinese Government to maximise their efforts to remove the

   underlying causes in order to end this phenomenon;
51. Urges China to ratify key International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions, in
    particular Convention No 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to
    Organise, as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China
    has signed but not yet ratified;
52. Welcomes China's transposition of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) into
    domestic law; encourages China to continue adopting IFRS while ensuring its
    implementation in practice; request the Commission to monitor closely the adoption and
    implementation of IFRS in China;
53. Calls on European businesses operating in China to apply the highest international standards
    and best practices in corporate social responsibility with regard to workers and the
    environment;
54. Expresses its concern about working conditions and employees’ rights in China; calls on
    China to improve working conditions in order to bring them up to the level of the core ILO
    standards;
55. Calls on the European Union and China to cooperate on standards on cars, trucks, heavy
    vehicles, aviation and shipping, in order to lower greenhouse gas emissions and make the
    standards more climate-friendly;
56. Calls for cooperation on the regulation, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH)
    between the European Union and China;
57. Is alarmed by the recent spate of incidents involving unsafe Chinese products and in
    particular by those involving children’s toys, food and medicines; welcomes the Chinese
    Government’s determination to tackle this problem; calls on the Commission to reinforce
    support and coordination with the Chinese authorities in this field;
58. Strongly condemns the death sentences imposed by the Chinese authorities on some of
    those involved in the contamination of powdered infant formula with melamine;
59. Welcomes the efforts the Commission has made in this area, thanks to the new system of
    quarterly reporting on Chinese enforcement actions to track down at source dangerous
    goods notified within the Rapex-China system, thus increasing European consumer safety;
60. Underlines the importance of the trilateral contacts between the Commission and the US
    and Chinese administrations aimed at improving the global governance of product safety; in
    this area; considers that it would be extremely useful for concrete shape to be given as soon
    as possible to the Commission’s proposal to establish a joint working party on product and
    import safety within the Transatlantic Economic Council;

Future Steps

61. Notes that Chinese society has changed greatly during the last 30 years and that lasting
    progress can take place only slowly; believes that democracy requires an effective civil
    society, which is in turn strengthened by trade and economic relations with the European
    Union; therefore believes that “change through trade” is a way to aid China's transformation
    towards being an open and democratic society benefiting all sections of society; while

   regretting that the intensification of economic and trade relations between the European
   Union and China has not gone hand in hand with substantial progress with regard to the
   human rights dialogue; believes that further reforms, especially in the environmental and
   social areas, are needed in order to ensure overall and lasting progress;
62. Regrets China's postponement of the EU-China summit which was to be held on 1
    December 2008 in Lyon given the current financial and economic crisis and stresses the
    utmost importance of a constructive dialogue on climate change as well as mutual
    understanding on the main trade issues at such a critical moment for the world economy;
    hopes that such a summit will take place as soon as possible;
63. Calls upon China to continue to fully contribute to efforts to speed up the negotiations under
    the Doha Development Agenda;
64. Stresses that the new EU-China PCA should aim to establish free and fair trade based on the
    enforcement of clauses on human rights, environmental, sustainable development and social
    issues;
65. Welcomes the establishment of the HLM as a forum for further developing EU-China
    relations at a strategic level and considers that an important element of this process is that
    the HLM results in the satisfactory resolution of trade irritants; calls on the Commission to
    put more ambition into the HLM by appointing one of its Vice -Presidents of the newly
    established Commission in 2009 as the coordinating Commissioner, leading the HLM-
    delegation;
66. Calls on the Commission to ensure that all existing research and development (R & D)
    agreements work effectively with China to promote cooperation on R & D; recommends
    concentrating R & D efforts between the European Union and China more strategically and
    in a more relevant way in terms of technology breakthroughs, needs of society,
    environmental disasters and future economic developments; asks both parties to facilitate
    the transfer of technology and technical know-how by facilitating researchers’ and
    academics’ exchange programmes;
67. Welcomes the rapprochement between China and Taiwan; considers Taiwan, which is the
    EU’s 4th largest trade partner in Asia, as an economic and commercial entity; supports
    Taiwan’s participation as an observer in relevant international organisations where this does
    not require statehood, for instance in the ILO;
68. Calls for increased cooperation between European and Chinese universities and increased
    mobility for scientists, researchers and students between the EU and China;
69. Supports the continued development of EU-China cooperation on space science,
    applications and technology; considers that close collaboration is essential for the
    coexistence of the Compass and Galileo programmes, in particular to ensure their
    compatibility in the interest of global users;
70. Urges the Commission and the Chinese Government to explore together means of
    developing a parliamentary dimension to the work of the HLM, mandated to reach out to
    the broader stakeholder community and to give a voice to their concerns;
71. Supports the efforts made by the Commission to establish an SME friendly business
    environment through the adoption of the Communication entitled ""Think Small First - A on
    the Small Business Act for Europe"" (COM(2008)0394), and in this regard welcomes the

   intention to launch a ‘Gateway to China’ scheme, with particular focus on establishing an
   Executive Training Programme in China to promote European SMEs’ access to the Chinese
   market by 2010;
72. Calls on China to promote cooperation between Chinese universities and EU SMEs to
    enhance SME innovation in China, thus creating more jobs and increasing trade and
    economic output; calls also on China to promote cooperation between the two sides to
    improve and enhance climate-friendly techniques and to minimise greenhouse gas
    emissions caused by EU SMEs in China;
73. Calls on the Commission to promote business-to-business cooperation, to raise awareness of
    the Market Access Database website and to improve dispute settlement mechanisms;
74. Encourages programmes designed to increase China-EU trade participation, such as the
    Executive Training Programme; calls on the Commission to increase technical assistance to
    China in order to implement health and safety rules and to improve customs cooperation;
75. Believes that the European Union and China are becoming more interdependent and that the
    complexities and importance of EU-China relations require greater coordination among the
    Member States and with the Commission; reminds China that it must fulfil its obligations
    arising from international agreements, is looking forward to an effective and outcome-

    will have a stand at EXPO 2010;
77. Calls on the Commission to support the setting up of a China-EU Business Council, similar

EU-China cooperation

1.   Looks forward to the advent of the EU-China Strategic Partnership and the closer
     cooperation which this will entail on a wide range of issues; urges the Council and the
     Commission to formulate a consistent and coherent policy towards China;

2.   Welcomes the work of the Commission in the sectoral dialogues with China, which
     currently cover a wide range of issues, ranging from environmental issues to social affairs
     and human rights, and requests that Parliament be briefed at regular intervals on progress
     made;

3.   Calls on China and the EU to establish their partnership and bilateral relationship on the
     basis of mutual openness and on the fundamental basis of credibility, stability
     responsibility and mutual understanding; urges both China and the EU to improve their
     cooperation on this basis in order to play a stable, responsible and credible role within the
     international community;

4.   Regrets that increased trade and economic relations with China have brought about no
     substantial progress in the field of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which are
     basic components of the political dialogue between China and the EU; takes the view, in
     this respect, that the development of trade relations with China must go hand in hand with
     the development of a genuine, fruitful and effective political dialogue;

Economic situation

5.   Notes that the EU, after enlargement, overtook Japan to become China’s largest trading
     partner and that, at the same time, China rose from being the EU’s third trading partner to
     become its second largest, after the US;

6.   Notes that in 2005, the Chinese trade balance amounted to USD 102 billion, which is
     more than twice as much as in the previous bench-mark year (USD 32 billion); that in
     2005, currency reserves amounted to approximately USD 819 billion - an increase of
     USD 209 billion compared to the previous year; that if this trend continues, China is
     likely to have at its disposal over USD 1 000 billion in foreign reserves at the end of
     2006, making it the world’s largest holder of foreign currency; that initial predictions for
     2006 point to a capital inflow of some USD 50 billion, primarily in long-term direct
     private investments; welcomes in this connection the fact that China has started to relax
     pegging its currency (Renminbi) to the US dollar and is thus not opposed to a possible
     currency revaluation; considers that warnings about insufficient risk surcharges for
     lending operations should be taken seriously;

7.   Takes note of China’s rapid economic development, making it the world’s fourth biggest
     economy in dollar terms, even at its current undervalued rate; accordingly calls on the
     Commission to exert political and economic pressure aimed at bringing flexibility to bear
     on the exchange rate of the Chinese currency, which is being pegged at an artificially low
     value, a situation that runs counter to gradual world trade liberalisation; calls on China to
     gradually float its exchange rate; calls on China to replace the fixed linking of its currency
     to the dollar with a linkage to a basket of currencies including the euro;

8.   Is concerned about the development of inequality and unfair distribution of wealth, mass
     unemployment and uncontrolled urbanisation, the rising crime rate and corruption and not

      least the environmental problems of China;

9.    Recognises that China is more than a fast-growing market; underlines the fact that the on-
      going technological revolution of a country of this size has huge implications in a global
      economy;

10.   Considers that balanced economic development is of great importance to both China and
      the EU; underlines the fact that stagnation of the Chinese economy due to uncontrolled
      growth is a serious threat both to China’s internal stability and to the wellbeing of the
      global economy; recognises that rapid economic growth in China presents a huge
      challenge to global efforts to tackle climate change, with CO2 emissions from coal-fired
      power stations set to double by 2030;

11.   Welcomes the fact that in autumn 2006 the Commission took the initiative of publishing a
      strategy paper on the Union’s long-term economic and trade relations with China in order
      to anticipate more adequately the impact of China’s economic rise and to avoid ad hoc
      decision-making, thus helping to ensure that China will no longer be considered a threat,
      but be perceived as a challenge and an evolving partner;

12.   Stresses that an increasingly positive trade relationship should also result in human rights
      reforms and recognises that, until there is a legally binding code of conduct on arms
      exports and until the situation regarding human rights and civil and political freedoms –
      including the Tiananmen Square issue – has been properly addressed, the EU should not
      lift the arms embargo;

13.   Calls on China to develop a solid and credible investment climate for foreign trade and
      industry and to give absolute priority to improving legal security for foreign companies;

14.   Reminds China that a further opening of its markets to foreign companies and investment,
      especially in the telecommunications, banking and financial services sectors, is to be seen
      as an integral part of the strategic partnership; calls on China to reform its market and its
      economic system accordingly, and to comply more rigorously with the anti-dumping rules
      and enforce them more strictly;

15.   In the light of the findings of the anti-dumping investigation in the footwear sector, which
      proved that China had been practising State intervention and social dumping, and of the
      steps taken by the Commission to correct this distortion of competition, urges the Union
      to make its trading partners, such as China, comply with fair and equitable international
      trade rules; calls on the Commission, when considering, as it is shortly due to do, how the
      anti-dumping measures should be used, to simplify the procedures so that anti-dumping
      mechanisms can be employed more readily by SMEs; furthermore, calls for the anti-
      dumping procedure to be made more transparent;

16.   Takes the view that, within the framework of efforts to modernise and liberalise the
      Chinese banking system, the EU should continue to work closely with the Chinese
      authorities with a view to adopting international accounting standards and the Basel II
      standards, which would ensure greater security for EU investors;

17.   Welcomes the rapid modernisation of the Chinese financial sector; stresses, however, the
      utmost importance of ensuring a smooth transition so as to avoid any financial instability
      with possible repercussions across global financial markets; suggests, in particular, that a

      ""race to the bottom"" involving harmful regulatory competition between global financial
      marketplaces should be avoided; suggests, on the contrary, that major regulators
      worldwide should promote standards of the highest quality; recalls that the EU itself is
      committed to the global convergence of standards in the areas of accounting
      (International Financial Reporting Standards), audit (International Standards on
      Auditing), capital requirements for credit institutions (Basel II), money laundering and the
      fight against financing terrorism (Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering
      (FATF) recommendations) and securities market regulation (International Organization of
      Securities Commissions standards); points out that the EU would be ready to offer its
      experience and assistance to the Chinese authorities to implement convergence where
      necessary;

18.   Considers that China is faced with considerable regional development disparities and
      more general income disparities, and that the new Chinese leadership must commit itself
      to tackling these problems with the help and expertise of the Commission;

19.   Calls on China to use a transparent and fair procedure in the award of public procurement
      contracts which gives foreign undertakings equal opportunities to participate;

20.   Considers that the pirating and counterfeiting of European products and brands by
      Chinese industries constitutes a serious violation of international trading rules; urges
      China to considerably improve the protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) with
      regard to both Chinese and foreign inventions; calls on China to uphold current laws
      regarding the protection of IPR; welcomes the creation of an IPR chair at the University
      of Beijing;

21.   Recognises the importance of MES for China; underlines, however, the fact that MES is
      an economic rather than a political instrument; urges China to reduce state interference in
      the economy and to improve its performance as regards its uneven compliance with
      corporate governance and accounting systems and its ineffective bankruptcy framework;

22.   Notes that the recent problems in the footwear sector show the need for China to adopt a
      more adequate anti-dumping policy; stresses the urgency of such a policy in the light of
      China’s WTO membership;

23.   Calls on the Council and the Commission to recognise that the difficulties faced by the
      textile, clothing, and footwear sectors are systemic, and calls on the Commission, when
      revising its economic and trade strategy in relation to China, to correct the current
      imbalances and anticipate the challenges;

24.   Calls on China to adopt an economic policy based more on social (education, health,
      pensions, etc.) and household consumption and less on investment and exports;

25.   Calls on the Commission to support the Chinese authorities in their campaign against
      intellectual property rights violations and product piracy;

Internal situation

26.   Shares the view that the future development of China is currently difficult to predict and
      will mainly depend on domestic issues such as the further smooth development of the

      economy and the gradual improvement of the living standards of the majority of the
      population;

27.   Wholly agrees with the conclusion in the above-mentioned White Paper that the concept
      of democracy and awareness of legal concepts inside the whole of Chinese society will
      need subsequent strengthening;

28.   Underlines the fact that the rapid socio-economic modernisation of the PRC should be
      combined with the necessary political pluralism and institutional modernisation and that it
      can amply nurture itself from indigenous sources such as the works of the liberal
      reformers of the late 19th century, and especially the basic thinking of Sun Yat-sen;

29.   Notes that social security, health and safety in the workplace, the right to form trade
      unions, industrial relations and social dialogue represent major challenges for China's
      future; calls on China to ratify key International Labour Organization Conventions,
      particularly Convention 87 concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the
      Right to Organise and 98 on Collective Bargaining and to comply with the framework
      provisions of the International Labour Organization regarding effective measures to
      combat all forms of modern slavery, child labour and exploitation, particularly of female
      workers, so as to ensure respect for the fundamental rights of workers and discourage
      social dumping; invites the Commission to intensify and to report back regularly on the
      structured dialogue with its Chinese counterparts in these fields;

30.   Takes the view that the denial of the right to form independent trade unions is counter-
      productive in the light of the increasing protests and demonstrations by workers
      throughout China against forced lay-offs, unpaid wages and other benefits, official
      corruption and mismanagement; therefore calls on the Chinese government to recognise
      and to guarantee the basic right to freedom of expression and association and the right to
      strike;

31.   Draws attention to the increasing problem of child labour in China and the adverse
      working conditions faced by child workers in the country despite the fact that child labour
      is prohibited under Chinese labour law; therefore urges the Chinese authorities not only to
      improve the enforcement of the law but also to tackle the root causes of the problem of
      child labour, such as growing economic disparities, the rapidly changing social structure
      and the failure of the educational system to provide adequate and affordable education for
      all children;

32.   Expresses its concern about the appalling socio-economic discrimination against China’s
      150 million migrant labourers from the countryside, takes note of the measures taken by
      the Chinese government to solve the problem, signalled by the new government
      guidelines officially published on 28 March 2006, and expresses its intention to follow
      the results of the implementation of this new policy carefully;

33.   Calls on the European Union to continue to keep the situation in Macao and Hong Kong
      under careful review and hopes that the encouraging aspects of the two experiences will
      serve as an example and a stimulus to move the Chinese political process forward;

34.   Postulates that as long as the CCP is not subjected to the order of a constitutional state,
      the party will remain a state within the state and thus very vulnerable to serious instances

      of abuse of power such as the national evil of cadre corruption, such a situation
      undermining the chances of creating a society based on the rule of law;

35.   Joins its voice to the criticism, expressed in Chinese lawyers' journals, that Article 126 of
      the Chinese Constitution should also include a prohibition on interference by the CCP or
      the Chinese Government in the course of justice;

36.   Expects fresh efforts to be made to strengthen the independence of the judiciary, and
      trusts that the gradual replacement of unqualified judges by competent jurists will curb
      the endemic corruption inside the judiciary and thus enhance popular trust in this
      fundamental state institution;

37.   Welcomes the promise made by the President of the Supreme People’s Court at the 10th
      National People's Congress that from July 2006 appeals against sentences imposing the
      death penalty will be conducted in open court; expects this promise to be acted upon;

38.   Urges China to abolish the death penalty and declare an effective moratorium in respect
      of persons already sentenced; takes note of the significant signal given by Chinese jurists
      that the death penalty should be imposed only in cases of serious, violent crimes, by
      contrast with the present situation, in which 68 offences are punishable by the death
      penalty, of which half do not involve capital offences; is concerned that China carries out
      far more executions than any other country in the world; calls on China to release its
      official figures for executions in the year 2005/2006;

39.   Strongly supports the demand made by Professor Liu Renwen, jurist and member of the
      Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, for the illegal trade in the organs of executed
      people to be brought to an end, by imposing strict provisions and controls;

40.   Is seriously concerned about the harsh action taken by the authorities against ""agitators"";
      notes that, according to a Blue Paper emanating from the Beijing Academy of Social
      Sciences, reasons for mass protests have included especially grave environmental
      problems that have endangered the health and existence of many farmers in newly
      industrialised regions, and also shameful expropriations of farmland for building
      purposes, not to mention the arbitrariness and corruption of local authorities;

41.   Welcomes the intention of the Chinese Government to bridge the growing income gap
      between the populations of the coastal regions and of the countryside, to tackle serious
      environmental problems, to demonstrate better stewardship of natural resources and to
      develop and stimulate more efficient technologies;

42.   Draws attention to the impact of China’s economic growth on natural resources and on
      the local and global environment notably as a result of CO2 emissions; calls on the
      Chinese Government to take all the necessary measures to protect the environment and in
      particular to ensure supplies of drinking water for the populace and take action in
      response to atmospheric pollution, and to conserve biodiversity; calls for an intensive
      dialogue between China and the European Union on natural resources and the
      environment;

43.   Urges the authorities to supervise their investment programmes in favour of the
      countryside very carefully, in the light of the fear expressed by Chinese researchers that
      local party cadres interpret references to ""new villages"" as a call for building projects at

      the expense of the farmers, and in view of the established fact that, hitherto, only one fifth
      of state subsidies for the agrarian sector has actually reached the farmers entitled thereto;

44.   Is very concerned about recent reports of continuing serious human rights abuses in
      Tibetan areas of China, including torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, house arrest and
      other non-judicial surveillance of dissidents, detention without public trial, repression of
      religious freedom and arbitrary restrictions on free movement; is deeply concerned about
      the intensification of the so-called ""patriotic education"" campaign since October 2005 in
      Tibet’s monasteries and nunneries, forcing Tibetans to sign declarations denouncing the
      Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist and proclaiming Tibet to be ""part of China"",
      including the arrest of monks from the Drepung Monastery in November 2005 for
      refusing to denounce the Dalai Lama; calls upon China to allow an independent body to
      have access to Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the Panchen Lama of Tibet, and his parents, as
      requested by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child; calls upon the Chinese
      Government to intensify its positive engagement in substantive negotiations regarding the
      demands of the Dalai Lama for autonomy for Tibet;

45.   Takes note that China's ""one-child"" policy has resulted in an imbalance in population
      distribution; urges China to recognise the fact that the future balance between the working
      and the non-working parts of the population will have huge economic effects; underlines
      the fact that the EU is also confronted with the problem of ageing; calls on China to
      rethink the concrete implementation of its ""one-child"" policy in order to tackle the
      economic and social disadvantages inherent in that policy;

46.   Urges the Chinese authorities to provide for measures in national legislation to protect the
      welfare of, and prevent cruelty to, animals, especially as regards the rearing of animals
      farmed for their fur; urges China to stop the abuse of animals for purposes of traditional
      medicine, as exemplified by the use of rhinoceros horn and bear bile;

Human rights

47.   Underlines the fact that the upholding of basic rights by the PRC requires the setting-up
      of a Constitutional Court, without which constitutional amendments, such as that of
      March 2004 on human rights, remain largely symbolic;

48.   Stresses that Chinese citizens should have a legal entitlement to their basic rights, and
      urges courts to fully address clear iniquities on the basis of the Constitution, thereby
      pursuing a healthy judicial process that is now, little by little, gaining momentum;

49.   Draws attention to the need for the state to abstain from regulating religion and
      expressions thereof; affirms the need, particularly in the light of the discussions among
      Chinese officials about the definition of ""religion"" and especially ""legal religion"", for a
      comprehensive law on religion meeting international standards and guaranteeing genuine
      religious freedom;

50.   Deplores the contradiction between the constitutional freedom of belief (enshrined in
      Article 36 of the Constitution) and the ongoing interference of the State in the affairs of
      religious communities, in particular as regards the training, selection, appointment and
      political indoctrination of ministers of religion; deplores especially the fact that the State
      accords the right of legal existence to only five religions and, moreover, places them
      under the control of the corresponding Chinese ""patriotic"" religious associations,

      protecting only ""normal"" (zhengchang) religious activities and making their official
      registration subject to acceptance of the principles underlying the umbrella organization
      the ""Three Autonomies"";

51.   Calls on the Council to inform it regarding the measures taken to follow up the
      declaration made in its above-mentioned resolution of 8 September 2005 regarding the
      fates of various bishops incarcerated in the PRC for their religious convictions; moreover,
      calls on the PRC's authorities to release forthwith all members of the Christian Church
      who are still unfairly incarcerated and persecuted;

52.   Notes that there are currently more Christians across China worshipping in ""illegal""
      places of worship (whether at Protestant house-churches or in underground Catholic
      groups loyal to the Vatican) than attending at ""patriotic"" places of worship, and that both
      groups of worshippers, composed as they are of law-abiding citizens, constitute no threat
      whatever to public security; calls on the Chinese Government to cease its persecution and
      imprisonment of such Christian groups; maintains that Christians who do not identify
      with the ""patriotic churches"" have the right to worship freely;

53.   Deplores the serious violation of religious freedom brought about by the recent unlawful
      ordinations of bishops (30 April 2006, Kunming – Yunnan; 3 May 2006, Wuhan –
      Anhui), stemming not least from the strong pressures and the threats to which the
      Catholic clergy loyal to the Vatican was subjected by non-Church bodies;

54.   Considers that the latest ordinations detract from the recent assertions by the Chinese
      authorities of their willingness to pave the way for a sincere and constructive dialogue
      between the PRC and the Holy See; points, therefore, to the need to respect the freedom
      of the Church and preserve the autonomy of its institutions from any external
      interference, which, as well as finding expression in gestures disavowing the demands
      negotiated by both sides, undermines confidence in reciprocal dialogue and advances in
      freedom in China;

55.   Points out that the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, after completing his mission,
      thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its cooperation, but rebuked the Ministries of
      State Security and Public Security for obstructing or restricting his attempts at fact-
      finding;

56.   Is deeply concerned by the statement made by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture that
      the practice of torture remains widespread in China, a reprehensible situation that is
      indeed increasingly recognised by government officials and in reports, and also by the
      ""palpable level of fear and self-censorship"" observed by him during interviews with
      detainees;

57.   Endorses the preliminary recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur to the
      Chinese Government, e.g. on reforming criminal law by adding the crime of torture in
      accordance with the definition contained in the UN Convention against Torture and Other
      Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and also establishing an
      independent complaints mechanism for detainees subjected to torture and ill treatment;

58.   Calls on the Chinese Government to revise the verdicts handed down for the crime of
      ""threatening public security"", given that, in an overwhelming majority of cases, the

      accused had done no more than courageously exercise their fundamental constitutional
      rights by openly criticising the policies of the government and the CCP;

59.   Once again calls on the Government of the PRC to improve the conditions of
      imprisonment in its jails and to cease and abolish the torture of detainees;

60.   Regrets that no substantial progress has been made regarding the release of political
      prisoners incarcerated for their involvement in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations and,
      similarly, regrets that the Chinese authorities continue to ignore calls for a full and
      impartial inquiry into the events of 1989; calls for an official reassessment of the
      Tiananmen Square incident by the Chinese authorities, publication of the list of political
      prisoners and their unconditional release;

61.   Deplores the recent crackdown by Chinese officials on defence lawyers aimed at
      stamping out legal challenges to their authority; calls upon the Chinese authorities to reveal
      the whereabouts of human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, one of China's most outspoken
      lawyers and dissidents who is held on suspicion of criminal activity, and to release him
      unless he is to be charged with a recognised criminal offence; similarly calls for the release
      of Chen Guangcheng, a peasants' rights advocate who has helped citizens in their attempts to
      sue their local authorities for carrying out forced abortions and sterilisations and who was
      sentenced to more than four years in prison, and of Bu Dongwei, who has been assigned to
      two and a half years of 'Re-education through Labour' (RTL) and who is detained at an
      undisclosed location; therefore urges the authorities to ensure that all human rights defenders
      can carry out peaceful and legitimate activities without fear of arbitrary arrest, torture or ill-
      treatment and that they be given access to proper legal representation in the event of arrest;

62.   Joins with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary
      Detention and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in urging the Chinese
      Government to abolish ""Re-education through Labour"" and similar forms of forced ""re-
      education"" of detainees in prisons, pre-trial detention centres and psychiatric hospitals;

63.   Rejects the nationwide Ankang system of police psychiatry applied to political and social
      dissidents, which purports to promise “health through rest and peace”, but in fact breaks
      its “patients”; admonishes the authorities against extending Ankang from 22 to 125
      clinics, but, on the contrary, to erase this national stain;

64.   Condemns in particular the existence of the Laogai labour camps across the country, in
      which the PRC detains pro-democracy activists, labour activists and members of
      minorities without a fair trial, forcing them to work in appalling conditions and without
      medical treatment; urges China to ratify ILO Conventions 29 and 105 on the Elimination
      of forced and compulsory labour; calls on China to give a written undertaking in relation
      to any given exported product that it has not been produced by forced labour in a Laogai
      camp and, if no such assurance can be given, insists that the Commission prohibit its
      importation into the EU;

65.   Calls on the PRC to respect its international obligations under the 1951 Geneva
      Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto, and to allow
      the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees full access to North Korean asylum
      seekers who may be in need of international protection;

66.   Strongly condemns the detention and torture of Falun Gong practitioners in prisons, ""Re-
      education through Labour"" camps, psychiatric hospitals and ""legal education schools""; is
      concerned about reports that organs of detained Falun Gong practitioners have been
      removed and sold to hospitals; urges the Chinese Government to end the detention and
      torture of Falun Gong practitioners and to release them immediately;

67.   Expresses its deep disquiet at the numerous violations of women's and girls' rights
      resulting from forced compliance with the Chinese Government's family planning policy,
      including selective abortions, forced sterilisations, and the abandonment of girls on a
      massive scale;

68.   Urges China without any further delay to ratify and implement the ICCPR;

69.   Agrees with the important message conveyed in the above-mentioned Reuters/BBC open
      letter – which was unfortunately withheld from the general public in China – that the
      current policy of censorship is hampering China’s political development;

70.   Expresses deep disquiet at the current clamp-down in the PRC on freedom of expression
      and free access to the Internet; repeats its requests to Beijing to refrain from intimidating,
      cracking down on or imprisoning those who advocate freedom of expression, whether the
      repression is directed at journalists or human rights activists or whether it makes
      information impossible to use by blacking out websites that do not conform to state
      censorship; condemns, therefore, the Internet censorship law passed by the National
      People's Congress and the existence of systems of Internet censorship collectively known
      as the 'Great Firewall of China'; calls in particular for the AsiaNews.it site to be allowed
      back onto the Web without delay – or in any event no longer be blacked out – bearing in
      mind that, in addition to being an excellent source of information about Asia and human
      rights advocacy, it also helps to foster dialogue between the Vatican and the PRC and
      hence the unity of the Chinese Church;

71.   Expresses its concern at the irresponsible policies of major Internet firms Yahoo and
      Google which have bowed directly and indirectly to Chinese Government demands for
      censorship;

72.   Calls on the Chinese authorities to re-open the office of the Friedrich Naumann
      Foundation in Beijing, so as to allow the Foundation to continue its work on development
      and democracy;

73.   Recognises the rising influence of China globally but in particular in countries as diverse
      as Belarus, Venezuela, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Burma/Myanmar, Iran and North Korea, of
      whose human rights records the EU remains deeply critical;

74.   Asks the Chinese authorities and the Council to improve the human rights dialogue by
      introducing simultaneous interpretation at meetings; requests that Members of the
      European Parliament be more actively involved in the human rights dialogue along with
      their Chinese parliamentary colleagues;

75.   Regrets that the authorities in Xinjiang regularly group together individuals or
      organisations allegedly involved in the ""three evils"", making it difficult to determine
      whether particular raids, detentions or judicial punishments are targeted at those
      peacefully seeking to express their political and religious views or at those who have

      engaged in violence; regards as counterproductive the destruction by officials of Uighur
      books with a view to distorting historical facts and advocating ethnic separatism;

76.   Looks forward to seeing the Chief Executive and all members of the Legislative Council
      of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region elected by means of an electoral system
      based on the principles of multi-party democracy, accountability of the government to the
      legislature and genuinely effective governance, which will confer a clear benefit on all the
      people of Hong Kong;

77.   Acknowledges the increasing role that China is playing as a global power on the      world
      stage; in this regard, urges the Chinese government to be fully committed to its growing
      responsibilities and to actively engage in international organisations and   fora so as to
      promote peace and peaceful conflict-resolution and to support the universal values of
      democracy, human rights and the rule of law;

Foreign policy/Relations with neighbours

78.   Draws attention to the concerns of the outside world, especially of Beijing’s regional
      neighbours, concerning the double-digit increase in China’s military spending every year
      since the mid-1990s; strongly recommends – as endorsed by numerous of its resolutions –
      that the EU arms embargo against China remain intact until greater progress is made on
      human rights issues; recalls in this context the need to include in further negotiations
      regarding the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Partnership and Cooperation
      Agreements, adherence to the EU embargo on arms trading with the PRC;

79.   Stresses the direct link between the obvious Chinese interest in gaining access to
      European military high technology and the lifting of the arms embargo against the PRC, a
      connection with significant consequences for the cohesion of the transatlantic relationship
      and the market position of the high-tech weapons industry in Europe;

80.   Expresses concern at the depth of cooperation with China on the Galileo programme and
      calls for further safeguards to be introduced to ensure that China, or other partners, cannot
      transfer sensitive technologies used in the programme to military applications;

81.   Observes that China's Anti-Secession Law of 14 March 2005 and the present stationing of
      more than 800 missiles on the south-east coast of the PRC facing Taiwan belie the
      principle of peaceful reunification; calls on China and Taiwan to establish mutual trust
      and respect and to seek common ground while setting aside differences, to put in place
      the necessary political basis for a peaceful and steady development of cross-Straits
      relations, to resume dialogue on those relations and to strengthen economic exchanges
      and cooperation, making progress in particular on the ""three direct links"" across the
      Taiwan Strait (mail, transport and trade);

82.   Takes the view that, with regard to the possible option of a peaceful reunification process
      with the Chinese mainland, the will and approval of the 23 million citizens of Taiwan
      must surely be respected and taken into account, as must Taiwan's territorial sovereignty
      and integrity, in negotiations with China on Taiwan’s status; points out that the beginning
      of a genuine democratic process in the PRC would help to ease tensions and pave the way
      for the resumption of a substantive dialogue between the two sides;

83.   Calls on China to support the possibility of observer status for Taiwan within the World
      Health Assembly of the World Health Organization, in order to protect the health of the
      people of Taiwan, of international representatives and foreign employees on the island,
      and of the entire population of the globe; recalls in this context that infectious diseases
      such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, SARS and, recently, avian influenza know no
      borders and require world-wide cooperation – also, and especially, with Taiwan as one of
      the most important international hubs in the Western Pacific; reiterates its call for Taiwan
      to be better represented in international fora and organisations, so as to put an end to the
      on-going unfair exclusion of 23 million people from the international community;

84.   Concludes that the problematic relationship between Beijing and Tokyo springs from a
      sense of mutual challenge: Japan feels challenged by China’s economic rise and China by
      Japan’s pursuit of a larger and more active political role in the region; calls on each
      country to refrain from any action which might offend the historic memory or the
      sensibilities of the other;

85.   Welcomes the American initiative of starting a strategic dialogue with Europe on China’s
      rise – a central new element in the policy of the ""new"" world towards the ""old"" – and
      encourages the European Union and its Member States to develop a strategic consensus
      for dealing with China;

86.   Highlights the global importance of China's existing and emerging energy relations;
      draws attention to the impact on the global energy market of the increase in China's
      energy consumption that will accompany its economic growth; calls on the Commission
      and the Council to include energy issues in their long-term strategy for EU-China
      relations and to raise this issue in their contacts with China where appropriate;

87.   Recognizes the special economic importance of the African Continent for the PRC (30%
      of its oil imports, a growing market for Chinese military hardware), but also urges the
      Chinese leadership to uphold China's responsibilities as a permanent member of the
      United Nations Security Council and to promote good governance, democracy, the rule of
      law, respect for human rights and conflict prevention in its relations with African states;

88.   Encourages the authorities in China to play an active role in bringing about respect for
      human rights and democratic change in Burma/Myanmar;

89.   Expects the PRC to apply its proclaimed opposition to terrorism and nuclear proliferation
      in a concrete manner in China's influential relations with Iran; emphasises that a decisive
      stance by the PRC on Iran would demonstrate China's willingness and ability to take on
      international responsibility;

90.   Welcomes China's commitment to the Six-Party Talks, and urges the Chinese
      Government to do more to promote security and stability in East Asia, particularly on the
      Korean Peninsula, and to play a more pro-active role in the promotion of democracy and
      respect for human rights in North Korea;

Conclusions

91.   Concludes that a credible, stable and responsible economic and trading relationship
      between the EU and China should be based, on the European side, on the development of
      a long-term strategy and, on the Chinese side, on the development of a solid investment

      climate, on improving legal security for foreign firms, on continuing to open its markets
      and, above all, on observance of fair and equitable trade rules and on implementation of
      the WTO rules, including compliance with the TRIPs agreements as regards the
      protection of IPR;

92.   Underlines the importance of addressing the concept of corporate social responsibility and
      the need to promote economically, socially and ecologically sustainable development in
      economic and trading relations between the EU and China; calls on the Commission to
      take care that these principles are applied;

93.   Draws the conclusion that China's internal situation should be improved by strengthening
      the indigenous process of democratisation, increasing the professionalism of the judiciary,
      completely abolishing the death penalty and above all, by implementing the government's
      social programme, endorsed by the 10th National People's Congress, in favour of the
      backward countryside in order to serve the Chinese population and to promote stability in
      the region, and also by minority protection and cultural diversity, especially in the regions
      of Tibet and Xinjiang;

94.   Concludes that a credible and responsible human rights policy can be restored in China
      only by respecting the basic rights of its citizens, as enshrined in the Constitution of the
      People's Republic;

95.   Comes to the conclusion that China can greatly contribute to credible, stable and
      responsible foreign and neighbourly relations by acknowledging its key position as a
      serious stakeholder in the international law- and peace-promoting system, a major step
      that the EU can significantly promote by formulating a new common strategy on China;

                                                   o

                                               o       o

96.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      governments and parliaments of the Member States and the accession and candidate
      countries, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese National
      People's Congress, and the Taiwan authorities.

EU/Russia and EU/China relations in the field of air transport
European Parliament resolution on relations with the Russian Federation and China in
the field of air transport (2005/2085(INI))

The European Parliament,

–    having regard to Rule 45 of its Rules of Procedure,

–    having regard to the report of the Committee on Transport and Tourism (A6-0375/2005),


China

1.   Welcomes the Commission's general response to the process of growth, modernisation
     and liberalisation currently underway in Chinese commercial aviation;

2.   Acknowledges the desirability of a comprehensive aviation agreement between the
     European Union and China; considers, however, that prior to the conclusion of a
     comprehensive agreement, a horizontal agreement should be reached so that China's
     current bilateral air service agreements with various Member States can be brought into
     line with the Court of Justice's 'open skies' judgment1;

3.   Accepts that the negotiation of such an agreement would strengthen the EU's position and
     would be more beneficial to stakeholders and consumers than a series of revised bilateral
     agreements essentially concerned with traffic rights;

4.   Calls on the Council without delaying the negotiating mandate to extend the
     Commission's negotiating mandate to cover the provision of the necessary airport and
     safety infrastructures and air traffic control over Chinese airspace, which unfortunately
     are inadequate at present and pose an obstacle to the development of aviation relations;

5.   Acknowledges the excellent work the Commission is carrying out with its Chinese
     partners, but regrets that it has not had access to the terms of the negotiating mandate the
     Commission now seeks from the Council in respect of China; insists that it be better
     integrated in the process of negotiating the agreement and hopes that this issue will be
     resolved, as this will benefit all parties;

6.   Insists that the provisions of a balanced conclusion to negotiations with China on air
     cargo should be implemented without delay and if necessary before completion of
     negotiations on passenger traffic.

Russia

7.   Welcomes the Commission's approach to the challenges and opportunities which the

     Judgment of 5 November 2002, Case C-476/98 Commission of the European Communities v
     Federal Republic of Germany 2002 ECR I-9855.

      growth and consolidation in the Russian civil aviation sector represent for the European
      Union;

8.    Supports the Commission's proposal that there should be a comprehensive aviation
      agreement, that being the best way of meeting this challenge and consolidating the
      Union's negotiating position with respect to Russia; considers, however, that, in line with
      the Conclusions of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council of 27 and 28
      June 2005 on external relations in the field of aviation, the acceptance of Community
      clauses should be a starting point for Community negotiations aimed at reaching a
      comprehensive agreement;

9.    Acknowledges the excellent work the Commission is carrying out with its Russian
      partners, but regrets that it has not had access to the terms of the negotiating mandate the
      Commission now seeks from the Council in respect of Russia; insists that it be better
      integrated in the process of negotiating the agreement and hopes that this issue will be
      resolved, as this will benefit all parties;

10.   Notes that the charges imposed by Russia for flights over its territory are in violation of
      international law and have not, in the main, been used for the promised improvement of
      air traffic control management but rather to subsidise Russia's own airline, in breach of
      competition law;

11.   Nevertheless insists to the Commission and Council that no comprehensive agreement
      should be concluded without the immediate and complete abolition of Russian overflight
      charges ;

12.   Further insists that no modified charging scheme should be agreed to replace the current
      overflight charging regime.

13.   Calls on the Commission not to conclude an agreement on the Russian Federation's
      accession to the World Trade Organisation while Russia continues to charge for Siberian
      overflights.

14.   In this context asks the Commission to evaluate all arguments related to modernisation,
      capital investment and technical requirements in the links between the European Union's
      and Russia's aviation industries and their differences over overflight charging.

China and Russia

15.   Emphasises that negotiations can only be successfully concluded with both China and
      Russia if stakeholders are able to advise the Commission and are fully apprised of the
      progress of negotiations and the positions adopted therein;

16.   Insists that no mandate should be granted which does not inexorably link increased access
      to both China's and Russia's markets to the creation of a 'level playing field' through the
      convergence of operating standards in the areas of air traffic control and management,
      staff training and operating standards and aviation security and safety; insists that the
      principle of reciprocity be applied;

                                                

                                                   

17.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.

Prospects for EU-China trade relations
European Parliament resolution on prospects for trade relations between the EU and
China (2005/2015(INI))

–   having regard to its resolution of 18 December 2003 on arms sales to China1,

A. whereas the rapid development of China over the past 20 years has had a significant impact

     on EU-China trade and economic relations, and whereas, overall, China is now the EU's
     2nd largest trading partner after the United States.; whereas in 2004 the EU had a deficit,
     vis-à-vis China, of EUR 78 500 million, its largest deficit with any trading partner, and one
     which reflects, among other things, the effect of market access barriers in China,

B. whereas China became a member of the WTO in 2001, reducing its average tariff and non-
   tariff barriers following its WTO commitments, leading to a growth in European
   investment projects in China; whereas, in some cases, however, the protection of Chinese
   domestic industries persists,

C. whereas by joining the WTO and opening itself up to international commerce, the most
   populous state on Earth has become a key player in world trade; whereas the impact of the
   production of a nation of 1.3 billion people can only increase; and whereas other countries
   with large populations (such as India, Brazil, Indonesia and many others) are bound to
   change the current ranking of exporting nations,

D. whereas the premise for trade between the EU and China is a strategic partnership with
   mutual market access on the basis of WTO rules and fair competition,

E. whereas China does not adequately apply WTO rules and whereas in particular it
   circumvents the ban on State export aid, infringes the laws on the protection of intellectual
   property, refuses to allow mutual access to its market in the case of goods and services
   from EU countries, and uses State intervention deliberately in order to depress the value of
   its currency, you protect the property, not the rights

F. whereas many of the rulings in the more than 9 000 piracy trials held in 2004 are not being
   effectively enforced,

G. whereas China does not at present meet the conditions for the granting of market economy
   status,

H. whereas Taiwan has played an important role in the economic rise of China,

I.   whereas owing to its continental scale, the number of its inhabitants and its dynamic
     economic growth in recent years, China is an economic superpower able to influence the
     course of the world economy and one with which all other economic areas are bound to
     have to compete,

J.   whereas Chinese expansion will bring enormous beneficial possibilities but also raises
     legitimate concerns for European industry, with an ensuing need for political management
     of those relations at European level,

K. whereas trade relations between the EU and China are at the heart of the debate on
   globalisation, and illustrate all the expectations and contradictions connected with it,

L. whereas the EU needs to find a response to the increasing public disquiet about the impact
   of globalisation which will be further fuelled by China’s increasing dominance of world
   markets,

M. whereas China has tripled its expenditure on research and development in the past five
   years and Europe must rise to this challenge in order to continue to benefit from world

     trade in future,

N. whereas the problems of the European textile industry were foreseeable, since the
   investments made by Chinese industry in this sector are well known, and this will not be an
   isolated case since similar situations exist in the production of other goods, such as
   footwear, and also in the bicycle industry, the car industry and the iron and steel industry,
   among others,

O. whereas the EU cannot remain complacent in the face of the challenges posed by China’s
   growing economic strength and must develop a coherent long-term strategic response,

P. whereas the impact of China’s rapid growth on its own natural resources and its
   environment and on the world market for resources is extremely high, and whereas EU
   companies are facing difficulties because of growing world market prices for resources due
   to the high demand from China,

Q. whereas in 2000 China ranked 97th in the world in terms of per capita emissions of
   greenhouse gases, but also as the second largest overall emitter in the world and has
   become the world's second-largest consumer of energy and raw materials; whereas
   projections for 2025 predict record high growth of Chinese emissions so China must play a
   very significant role in relieving the burden on the world environment,

R. whereas the gradual advent of a fairer and safer world requires there to be greater solidarity
   not only between the peoples of the developed nations and those of the less developed
   nations, but also within the various nations,

S. whereas it is politically and economically in the interests of the EU to support China's
   development into a free and open State where the rule of law prevails and its full adoption
   of democracy and the market economy,

T. whereas the economic development of China also gives the country greater responsibility
   in the Asian region,

U. whereas it is the duty of the EU, as the world's leading economic power, not only to nurture
   its trade relations with all its partners but also to uphold the universal values of humanity,
   democracy and the rule of law; whereas in this respect China, despite its recent economic
   success, is far from allowing all its citizens to benefit from the full range of democratic and
   human rights,

1.   Welcomes China’s timely implementation of some of its WTO obligations, but calls for
     further dialogue to enable China to rapidly address the many outstanding areas of concern
     to EU industry, particularly in the fields of Intellectual Property Rights enforcement,
     national treatment, transparency and environmental, social and health standards;

2.   Calls on the Commission, in the light of the numerous instances of inadequate
     implementation or application by China of its WTO obligations, to offer European
     companies its support in this connection, providing them with effective backing;

3.   Takes the view that the EU must seek to establish trade links with China in a spirit of

     cooperation and complementarity, while ensuring that each can maintain and develop their
     industrial, agricultural and service sectors harmoniously in order to ensure the best possible
     living standards for all their inhabitants;

4.   Urges China to abide by the spirit as well as the letter of Section 18 of its Accession
     Protocol so that the Transitional Review Mechanism can become a more effective tool for
     resolving outstanding areas of concern;

5.   Calls on the Commission to assess carefully whether to award China the status of a market
     economy country, and only to grant it that status once China has fulfilled the relevant
     criteria;

6.   Takes the view that the pirating and counterfeiting of European products and brands by
     Chinese industries is a serious violation of international trade rules; calls on the
     Commission to take the appropriate measures to protect the intellectual property of
     European companies, including supporting the Chinese authorities in the fight which they
     are starting to wage against piracy, monitoring the problem and, if necessary, bringing it
     before the WTO;

7.   Calls on the Member States to develop effective market controls in order to protect
     European consumers as well as possible against products which do not comply with the CE
     standard;

8. Calls on the Commission to adopt the necessary measures to prevent the import into the
   European Union of any article manufactured with high risk chemical products that
   European manufacturers would be prohibited to use under European or national legislation;

9.   Calls on China to guarantee the same conditions to all its trading partners and not to put up
     bureaucratic barriers to trade, and to take appropriate account of the concerns expressed by
     the EU and by industry, including in the areas of corruption, legal certainty, taxation,
     credit, etc;

10. Calls on China, as a WTO member, to comply with international standards in the area of
    statistics;

11. Calls on the Commission to study what impact China's liberalisation of trade and
    membership of the WTO has had on growth and on social progress in the country;

12. Calls on China, given its importance in international trade, to bring greater influence to
    bear in the context of the Doha Development Agenda through its role as a link to third
    world countries, and thus to contribute to a successful outcome of the next Doha Round in
    Hong Kong;

13. Calls on China to open up its markets to foreign goods and services, and to carry out
    appropriate reforms of its market and its economic system;

14. Calls on China, when awarding public contracts, to use a transparent and fair procedure
    which gives foreign companies an equal chance to participate;

15. Calls on China to improve links between its transport networks and international networks,
    in order to facilitate the free movement of persons and goods;

16. Calls on the Commission and China to develop effective measures in order, in future, to put
    an end to the repeated infringements in relation to the correct levying of protective tariffs;

International competitive effects

17. Welcomes the Memorandum of Understanding of 10 June 2005 between the Commission
    and the Chinese Government on the limitation of Chinese textile exports and calls on the
    Commission to monitor both compliance with that agreement and the situation with regard
    to other textile, clothing and footwear sectors in Europe, while also taking account of the
    long-term interests of European importers and retailers; calls on China to make the
    calculation system being used to limit exports transparent; urges the Commission to be
    prepared to adopt emergency measures if it becomes clear that the EU industry faces
    serious material injury; further urges the Commission and China to find solutions for the
    developing countries which are most vulnerable to Chinese exports, enabling them to
    protect parts of their markets, in order to find a solution for some of the poorest people;

18. Is concerned that the way in which the Memorandum of Understanding was initially
    implemented caused serious disruption to some European retailers; welcomes the fact that,
    following new discussions with the Chinese authorities, this problem now appears to have
    been addressed, at least in the short term; calls on the Commission to continue to monitor
    the situation, with a view to ensuring that there is no further disruption either in the field of
    textiles or in other sectors where Chinese competition is significantly increasing;

19. Calls on the Commission to study the long-term survival prospects of production of textiles
    and clothing in the EU, bearing in mind the scope for imports from China and other
    countries, and welcomes the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the
    Council on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property
    rights (COM(2005)0276), which it hopes to see rapidly adopted;

20. Urges the Commission to meet the growing unease of developing countries about the
    effects on their markets of Chinese textile exports by urgently conducting a country-by-
    country assessment of the full impact of the quota phase-out;

21. Calls on the Council and the Commission to recognise that the challenges currently being
    experienced by the textile, clothing and footwear sectors, and which will soon be
    experienced by other sectors such as the bicycle, automobile, machinery and iron and steel
    industries, are systemic in nature, and that a longer-term strategy for EU industry must
    urgently be developed in order for the EU's international trade policy to take into account
    and address in advance the challenges, such as the current imbalances it is experiencing
    with China, posed not just to EU and developing country jobs, but also to existing
    assumptions about the winners and losers from globalisation;

22. Calls on the Commission to monitor, and regularly report on, the extent to which Chinese
    competition is affecting EU industry, as well as on trends in the quantity and sectoral
    composition of out-sourcing from the EU, in order to evaluate the positive and negative
    effects of such trends and to develop appropriate policy responses;

23. Calls on the Commission to re-examine thoroughly the various safeguard provisions of the
    WTO agreements, to evaluate whether they remain adequate in the light of the changing
    international trade paradigm, and to publish its findings;

24. Notes that the increase in the volume of Chinese textile exports to the EU has been
    accompanied by a sharp fall in the value of those products, by as much as 60% of their
    purchase value, without European consumers having significantly benefited; calls on the
    Commission to investigate whether there have been any agreements between importers
    and/or major distributors and to ensure transparency in the price formation process;

25. Recognises that liberalisation affects men and women differently, and that the threat of the
    garment industry collapsing in many poor countries after the abolition of quotas risks
    severely weakening the position of women in these countries;

26. Calls on the Commission to prepare a long-term development forecast for global industry
    and a strategy for EU industrial development for the purpose of identifying possible future
    development trends in EU industries to ensure a competitive response to all global
    challenges;

27. Calls on the Commission to create a closer comprehensive partnership which would be
    beneficial to China and the EU, to extend this cooperation to more areas and to work
    towards actively overcoming negative factors between the two parties;

28. Calls for trade relations between the EU and China to contribute to a balanced and
    sustainable economic, social and environmental development but also to regional
    development, since unbalanced development would entail great dangers for internal and
    external security;

29. Calls on the Commission and the Council to make a thorough study of the opportunities for
    European businesses and industry arising from economic development in China;

30. Calls on the Commission to promote business cooperation, raise awareness and facilitate
    contacts in order to promote greater regulatory convergence (common standards,
    conformity assessment, technical regulation, improved accounting practices, improved
    dispute settlement mechanism, etc.);

31. Calls on the Commission to undertake more extensive research on an ongoing basis to
    better understand the full scope of the off-shoring issue, including adequate programmes
    for collecting data on jobs that move off-shore, precise analysis of the economic costs of
    off-shoring (including loss of tax revenue), data on redeployment of workers and on their
    new wage levels, and analysis of the positive and negative wider effects on communities;

32. Calls on the Commission to state to what extent the current low sale and import prices for
    Chinese products are benefiting consumers in Europe, and what medium and long-term
    trends the Commission expects to see in this connection;

33. Notes that manufactured products represent practically 75% of world trade in goods and
    services, while the manufacturing sector only accounts for around 20% of world GDP;
    points out that relocations essentially concern manufactured products with no great added
    value and that these industrial changes primarily affect the most vulnerable and least
    qualified workers, and hence those least able to adapt; calls accordingly for strong social
    solidarity to be shown with such workers, not least in the form of greater investment in
    their training and retraining, in order to redirect them towards jobs in sectors in which
    Europe is still a world leader;

34. Asks the Commission to investigate precisely which sectors are currently benefiting, or
    will benefit in future, from China's tremendous economic growth, how many jobs have
    been preserved or created in these sectors, what strategies the Commission intends to adopt
    to identify and promote other similar sectors in order that on balance the effect on
    European economies in terms of employment and prosperity will be a positive one, and
    what EU Member States will retain in the high-tech sector that is not capable of being
    carried out by lower-wage competitors, and in particular by China;

35. Asks the Commission to investigate the introduction of a European labelling scheme that
    would indicate country of origin, as well as social and environmental standards;

36. Calls on the Council and the Commission to make use of the EU countries' political and
    economic influence in order to bring about a change in China's attitude towards compliance
    with international trade rules and towards transparency in the allocation of State aid to
    businesses, with a view to preventing any circumvention of the ban on State export aid and
    to removing administrative and government barriers to imports from the EU Member States
    and from third countries;

37. Recognises, however, that alongside the evident concerns expressed, China represents a
    market of great potential for European investors, and that only a fraction of it has been
    exploited until now; calls on the Commission therefore to pinpoint the most effective
    means of assisting European industry to seek out and seize all the opportunities offered by
    that large and expanding market;

38. Notes that China's current account surplus has fallen from 3.1% of GDP in 2003 to 1.1% of
    GDP in 2004, owing not least to a rapid increase in imports to China; notes that China is
    now the EU's second largest trading partner and that the outlook for European exports to
    that large market remains promising; takes the view that China will also reach limits to its
    growth, since the necessary measures taken to restrain population growth will result in an
    inversion of the age pyramid by 2015 at the latest;

39. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ascertain whether the aid to China
    granted under their current and future development programmes also brings financial
    advantages for Europe or European companies;

40. Stresses that China's rapid rise is due partly to the intense economic ties between China and
    Taiwan, which are reflected in the presence of 1 million Taiwanese in China working in
    more than 60 000 Taiwanese businesses and the many Taiwanese investments in China;

41. Expresses its concerns about the operation of the Chinese non-ferrous metals sector which
    leads to a structural distortion of the international market for recycling non-ferrous metals;
    calls on the Commission to investigate the situation and, if appropriate, to pursue WTO
    remedies so as to ensure that EU firms have access to scrap under fair conditions;

42. Supports the Council and the Commission in their efforts to achieve flexibility and
    establish a true value for China's currency in relation to the international financial markets,
    following the introduction of the euro;

43. Calls on China to continue gradually to decontrol its currency's exchange rate, and in the
    meantime to replace the fixed link to the dollar as soon as possible with a link to a basket of
    currencies including the euro; further calls on China to liberalise its financial markets;

44. Calls on the Commission, jointly with China to explore ways of opening up Chinese
    markets more to foreign companies, and enabling and encouraging foreign companies to
    set up business without being obliged to have a Chinese partner;

45. Welcomes the fact that the Commission is preparing a New Framework Agreement with
    China and calls for the EU to strengthen its representation in China;

Social and Environmental Impacts

46. Notes that China has managed to extricate over 300 million of its citizens from poverty in
    20 years, but expresses its concern that around one quarter of the rural population in China
    still live in extreme poverty, and that Chinese income inequalities are among the fastest
    growing in the world; calls on the Commission to support China in further developing a
    cohesion policy and to take this issue into account in trade relations with China;

47. Recognises that, despite improved economic prospects for many Chinese, this has not
    alleviated the need for a more even geographical spread of economic development to
    reduce the threat of even higher unemployment and social displacement in the future;

48. Calls upon China to incorporate into its laws the International Covenant on Civil and
    Political Rights and the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights as
    one means - amongst others - of establishing minimum social and environmental
    standards;

49. Is deeply concerned at the lack of workers’ rights in China, the very low level of wages and
    the increasing number of industrial accidents due to inadequate health and safety
    regulations, and urges China to ratify the key Conventions of the International Labour
    Organization, particularly Convention 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the
    Right to Organise, and 98 on Collective Bargaining, and to abolish the State monopoly on
    the formation of trade unions provided for in China's legislation; moreover calls on China
    to take steps to effectively combat all forms of present-day slavery, child labour and
    exploitation and above all exploitation of women at work, so as to ensure that workers'
    fundamental rights are respected and so as to put an end to social dumping;

50. Notes the steady rise in the number of industrial disputes since 1998; to address this, urges
    China to authorise the establishment of independent trade unions for example through the
    creation of a strong legal status, the introduction of free collective bargaining, the
    opportunity for democratically elected trade union officials to receive independent training
    and the setting up of an exchange programme between European and Chinese trade union
    officials to enable China to benefit from Europe's many years of experience in the area of
    employee participation; urges China to institute a social protection system appropriate to
    people’s needs and geared towards the unemployed;

51. Acknowledges China's increasing competitiveness in today's international economic
    climate but calls on China to take effective and swift action against the use of child labour
    and forced labour; asks the Commission to offer the Chinese its support in this connection;

52. Calls on the Commission and the Council to be vigilant with regard to a possible restriction
    of the free organisation of trade unions in Hong Kong; draws attention to the positive role
    which the free organisation of trade unions in Hong Kong could play in improving labour
    rights in China;

53. Calls on the Commission and the Council, in their dialogue with China, to stress the
    importance of releasing labour activists;

54. Calls on the Commission to explore suitable ways of increasing mutual understanding and
    appreciation of respective cultural characteristics and of improving awareness and
    acceptance of the European legal and economic system;

55. Looks to Western, particularly European, businesses operating in China to give full
    recognition to trade union rights and behave in an exemplary manner towards workers and
    the environment;

56. Is seriously concerned about the high levels of pollution caused by China's industries and
    the growing consumption of natural resources such as timber from unsustainable sources
    and welcomes recent signs that China is taking serious measures to protect the
    environment; emphasises that trade and environment are an essential component of the
    WTO, and urges the Chinese government to play a full and positive role in promoting
    sustainable development, both inside China and globally; notes that because of China's
    size, its large-scale adoption of sustainable technologies and practices could have a positive
    global impact, lowering costs and spurring other nations to follow suit, and urges the
    Chinese authorities to make full use of this potential for China to play a leadership role in
    environmental matters;

57. Expresses its concern that the enormous economic growth in China is leading not only to
    environmental pollution but also to scarcity of resources and rising commodity prices on
    the world market; calls upon China to accept responsibility for incorporating environmental
    standards into manufacturing and waste management and for helping to repair damage to
    the environment; calls on the Commission to start identifying solutions to the problem of
    how to guarantee in future affordable, stable raw material and energy supplies to people
    and companies in Europe;

58. Urges, in addition, the Council and the Commission to use all appropriate bilateral
    channels, as well as multilateral institutions and agreements to which both the EU and
    China are parties, to further press the case for high standards of social welfare and
    environmental protection as an essential component of international solidarity;

59. Recognises the key role of China in finding an effective solution to global warming and
    urges the Chinese Government to continue its constructive engagement in international
    negotiations to avoid dangerous climate change; stresses the importance of continuing
    efforts to reduce fossil fuel use;

60. Calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure, through the EU-China Energy and
    Environment Programme and other channels, that collaboration on renewable
    energy/energy efficiency issues will be a priority for future EU-China co-operation, and to
    encourage China’s development of sustainable technologies and industries, particularly to
    enable cooperation in developing new technologies that will make a sustainable future
    possible; calls on China, when building new coal-fired power stations, to use the latest,
    most efficient and most environmentally-friendly technologies, and as soon as possible to
    use so-called clean coal technologies in the construction of such power stations; further
    calls on China to improve safety standards in its coal mines; calls on the Commission to
    offer the cooperation of European mining technology companies; calls on China, in the
    event of the possible building of new nuclear power stations, to make use of European

    experience and safety technology and to cooperate closely with European manufacturers
    and authorities such as the International Atomic Energy Agency;

61. Calls on the Commission to investigate the most effective way of negotiating the
    introduction of minimum social and environmental standards into trade agreements and
    ensuring their effective enforcement;

62. Welcomes the Commission's initiative to tackle imports of illegal timber and wood
    products from countries including China by its proposed Action Plan on Forest Law
    Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT); is concerned, however, that the negotiation
    of partnership agreements with countries on a voluntary basis would not address the
    problem sufficiently;

63. Notes that most of the wood imported into the EU from China comes in the form of
    processed products, some of which are derived from wood which China has sourced
    illegally;

64. Calls on the Commission and the Council to put pressure on the Chinese authorities to take
    appropriate far-reaching measures to stop the import of illegal timber and wood products,
    and to encourage China to play a full role in regional and international processes, such as
    East Asia FLEG, aimed at curbing trade in illegally-sourced timber;

Existing projects, governance

65. Welcomes the Commission's well-developed programme of cooperation with China on
    environmental matters, through its funding of assistance projects, and calls on it to ensure
    that the programme is continued and expanded; welcomes the general willingness of the
    Chinese Government to cooperate on environmental protection;

66. Recognises that many of China's environmental problems stem not from lack of laws but
    from lack of law enforcement, and therefore calls on the Commission to make capacity
    building at the local level an important focus of cooperation projects;

67. Encourages an increase in programmes such as the Executive Training Programme to
    increase trade participation between China and the EU;

68. Calls on the Commission to implement the pledge which it made to the European
    Parliament on 8 March 2005 and to offer to send European customs officers to China to
    provide support and training;

Education

69. Calls on the Commission to agree with the Chinese Government to stimulate mutual
    learning and student exchange; further urges the Commission to create more Chinese-
    language schools throughout the EU with the possibility of scholarships or funds for EU
    students interested in learning Chinese;

Political Dialogue

70. Looks to the EU, in parallel with the development of trade relations, to carry on a more
    intensive political dialogue, ranging from human rights matters to regional and global
    security issues;

71. Regrets that China's rapid economic development has not been accompanied by progress in
    political and civil rights for the population and that the official human rights dialogue in
    which the EU and China have engaged since 1997 in parallel with their growing trade and
    economic relations has not been successful; therefore stresses the need for a different
    approach including the establishment of a clear and effective policy of human rights
    conditionality with regard to the EU's general trading policy with China;

72. Reiterates its concern about the human rights situation in China; notes that the situation has
    seen some progress over the past fifteen years; stresses that more needs to be done and
    considers that the human rights dialogue between China and the EU should be consistently
    improved;

Arms embargo

70.    Draws attention to the fact that the arms embargo was imposed on China by the EU and
       the US (and others) as a direct result of the Chinese authorities' brutal suppression of the
       democratic demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in June 1989; deems it inappropriate
       for the EU to lift the embargo at this juncture;



                                                °

                                            °       °

74. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and the
    governments and parliaments of the Member States and of China.

     Security and Defence Policy and the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External
     Trade, Research and Energy (A5-0112/2003),

A.   whereas sovereignty over Hong Kong was transferred from the United Kingdom to the
     People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997,

B.   whereas the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 19 December 1984 and the Basic Law of
     1990 guaranteed that, after the transfer of sovereignty, the existing economic system and
     way of life would remain unchanged for 50 years,

C.   whereas the European Union continues to support the 'one country, two systems' principle
     on which Hong Kong's present and future autonomy under China is based, and whereas
     the European Parliament has been a staunch defender of this autonomy,

D.   whereas this principle has continued to function well, although its implementation in
     certain areas has raised some concerns,

E.   whereas many groups have expressed serious concern at the proposed implementation of
     Article 23 of the Basic Law, which would provide for heavy penalties, including
     imprisonment, for treason, sedition, subversion and theft of state secrets, but whereas
     precise definitions of these crimes have not yet been produced,

F.   whereas the large demonstration held in Hong Kong on 15 December 2002 illustrated the
     genuine concern that Article 23 laws must not undermine existing human rights and civil
     and religious liberties,

G.   whereas it has maintained a constructive dialogue with the Government of the HKSAR,

H.   whereas the HKSAR Chief Secretary for Administration, Donald Tsang, visited the
     European Parliament for an exchange of views with the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
     Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 22 November 2001, whereas
     HKSAR Financial Secretary, Antony Leung, particpated in meetings in the European
     Parliament in November 2002, and whereas Henry Tang, Secretary for Commerce,
     Industry and Technology for the HKSAR Government visited the European Parliament on
     27 January 2003,

I.   whereas Hong Kong was, in 2002, named the world's freest economy for the 9th
     consecutive year (Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom),

J.   whereas, however, Hong Kong has just gone through 4 ½ years of deflation; aware of the
     increasing deficit of almost HKD 70 billion and of increasing unemployment, which
     currently runs at 7-8%,

K.   whereas, under the Basic Law, Hong Kong is a separate customs territory, and whereas,
     as such, it is a member in its own right of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and
     whereas the EU welcomes its constructive participation in the Organisation,

L.   whereas the accession of China to the WTO strengthens Hong Kong’s economic position
     in the region and the establishment of free trade areas that are open to the outside world is
     a development factor which may acquire major significance for Hong Kong in the future,

M.   whereas Hong Kong must continue to stimulate and develop its economic activities if it
     wishes to remain competitive now that China has joined the World Trade Organisation
     and also in the light of the growing integration with China itself,

N.   whereas Hong Kong is an important economic partner with which the European Union
     also continues to have an interest in maintaining good relations,

O.   whereas many EU companies are involved in the banking, insurance and securities
     industries in Hong Kong and many more have their regional headquarters in the HKSAR,

P.   whereas, in economic and trade terms the HKSAR is closely linked to the West, making it
     ideally suited as a strategic link between Europe and Asia,

Q.   whereas, in a Joint Statement issued after the 21 May 2002 meeting in Brussels HKSAR
     Chief Secretary Donald Tsang and Commission President Romano Prodi announced that
     Hong Kong and the European Union had agreed to build a closer and stronger
     partnership,

Institutions

1.   While acknowledging that the new accountability system has only been in existence for a
     short time, takes note of the criticism that it concentrates power in the hands of the Chief
     Executive and has the potential to politicise the civil service;

2.   Welcomes the commitment given in the 2003 Policy Address to maintain ""a small but
     responsive and accountable government and a permanent, meritocratic, professional,
     politically neutral and clean civil service"";

3.   Believes that the promised review of constitutional developments post 2007 should
     prepare for the election of the Chief Executive in 2007 and the Legislative Council in
     2008 on the basis of universal suffrage;

4.   Expresses its concern that recent measures relating to Hong Kong's civil service that
     either have been or will be implemented in the political and economic fields could
     demoralise and undermine that service, which is universally respected for its
     professionalism and integrity;

Rule of Law

5.   Considers that the rule of law implemented by independent courts exercising the power of
     final jurisdiction guarantees the autonomy of Hong Kong, and believes that a
     reinterpretation of the Basic Law should never be sought from the Standing Committee of
     the National People's Congress once a decision has been made by the Court of Final
     Appeal;

6.    Stresses that any legislation introduced under Article 23 must not interfere with the
      exclusive jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts; regrets the decision of the HKSAR
      government to ignore the legitimate and strongly supported demand for the publication of
      a white bill on proposed Article 23 legislation, to be followed by a second round of public
      consultation;

7.    Expresses its serious concern with regard to several aspects of the proposed Article 23
      legislation particularly the proposals relating to the proscription of organisations outlawed
      in mainland China on national security grounds and the totally inadequate appeal
      mechanism, which runs contrary to the spirit of Article 35 of the Basic Law;

8.    Notes that although no agreement has been reached on the mutual rendition of offenders,
      believes that any future agreement on this issue must guarantee that in both jurisdictions
      the trial proceedings would be in accordance with the ICCPR and that in no
      circumstances would capital punishment be used;

Human Rights

9.    Reiterates its call for the establishment of a Statutory Human Rights Commission - which
      will assume even more significance when Article 23 legislation is introduced - as such a
      body would ensure an effective balance between this legislation and respect for
      fundamental human rights;

10.   While welcoming the commitment in the 2003 Policy Address to consider introducing
      legislation against racial discrimination, believes that this legislation should be enacted
      immediately to give effect to the International Convention on the Elimination of All
      Forms of Racism;

11.   Welcomes the establishment of the Race Relations Unit within the Home Affairs Bureau
      but believes it is essential that an independent body be set up to deal with discrimination,
      with statutory backing and enforcement powers;

12.   Calls on the HKSAR administration to implement the recommendations of various United
      Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies;

13.   Urges the HKSAR government to undertake immediate measures for a just and humane
      solution to the problem of families split between Hong Kong and mainland China,
      including those whose family members had to return to mainland China after having their
      permanent residence in Hong Kong revoked by the re-interpretation of the Basic Law by
      the Standing Committee of the N.P.C.;

14.   Is critical of the continuing situation where some members of the Legco are denied access
      to mainland China; in this context, calls on the Council Presidency and the Commission
      to raise the issue with China;

15.   Expresses its concern at the inconsistent approach of HKSAR authorities with regard to
      its immigration policy and in particular criticises the decision to deny entry to Mr. Harry
      Wu in April 2002;

16.   Expresses concern at the comments made by the Chief Executive to the LegCo on the 14
      June 2001, when he described the Falun Gong as an ""evil cult""; is further concerned by
      the speculation that the administration conducted a study of anti-cult legislation in other
      countries, states therefore its strong opposition to any move on the part of the Hong Kong
      authorities to ban the Falun Gong; urges the authorities to recognise that the great
      majority of practitioners in no way threaten the authority of the government but equally
      believes the Falun Gong should pursue its right to practice in a responsible and non-
      confrontational manner;

17.   Acknowledges the excellent work being done by the Office of the Ombudsman, the
      Privacy Commissioner's Office, the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Independent
      Commission Against Corruption, and urges the HKSAR government to ensure that they
      have the necessary resources to operate independently in the discharge of their tasks;

Economy

18.   Welcomes the strategy outlined in the 2003 policy address to conclude negotiations by
      June 2003 on the main aspects of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA)
      with mainland China;

19.   Seeks assurances that it will be compatible with WTO rules especially those pertaining to
      sectoral coverage of Free Trade Agreements;

20.   Urges the HKSAR, in the context of CEPA, to provide a clear definition of a ""Hong Kong
      company or enterprise"" and also further clarification on the issues of the rules of origin
      and import licensing;

21.   Supports the strategy of economic integration with the Pearl River Delta (PRD) as
      outlined by the Chief Executive in his Policy Address as a potentially important and
      exciting initiative which will revitalise the Hong Kong economy;

22.   However, in expressing support for both the CEPA and the PRD initiatives, underlines the
      fact that these should be implemented on the basis of the ""one country, two systems"" and
      should not undermine this in any way;

23.   Supports the view that the introduction of fair competition laws and practices would
      strengthen the Hong Kong economy;

24.   Urges Hong Kong to keep improving its legislation against money laundering and its anti-
      terrorism measures in the financial field;

SARS Outbreak

25.   Notes the reports that by early April 2003, over twenty deaths and almost one thousand
      recorded cases have been attributed to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)
      epidemic in Hong Kong; nonetheless welcomes the actions of the Hong Kong healthcare
      professionals and scientists in responding to the SARS outbreak; expresses concern at the
      lack of transparency, lack of information-sharing and unnecessary delays by the
      authorities of the Peoples Republic of China in responding to the discovery of the deadly
      respiratory disease; therefore believes that Hong Kong's further integration with the Pearl

      River Delta (ie. the Guangdong province) should not exclusively be about building roads
      and bridges and easing border control but should also promote public health and disease
      cooperation and calls for a sufficient alert system to be established;

Environment

26.   Is aware that although some improvements have taken place, there is still criticism of the
      environmental policies of the HKSAR government, as documented by the Hong Kong
      Foreign Chambers of Commerce Association; welcomes therefore, initiatives that were
      promised in the 2003 Policy Address, including proposals for a ""polluter pays"" principle
      scheme, a pilot emissions trading scheme between Hong Kong and Guandong, further
      recycling, nature conservation and water management measures, and calls for their swift
      implementation;

Further areas for EU-HKSAR Cooperation

27.   Calls on the Commission to explore possible areas for cooperation between the European
      Union and the HKSAR where there can be exchanges of experience and ideas,
      particularly in the fields of education, the environment, and cross-border cooperation, and
      to provide the necessary resources to facilitate this;


                                                  o
                                              o       o


28.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      governments of the Member States, the Government of the People's Republic of China,
      the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the Legislative
      Council (LegCo).

Macao SAR
European Parliament resolution on the report from the Commission to the Council and
the European Parliament on the Macao Special Administrative Region: First and Second
Annual Reports (COM(2001) 432 - COM(2002) 445 - C5-0619/2002 - 2002/2275(INI))


The European Parliament,

–     having regard to the first Annual Report by the Commission on the Macao Special
      Administrative Region (COM(2001) 432) – C5-0619/2002),

–     having regard to the second Annual Report by the Commission on the Macao Special
      Administrative Region (COM(2002) 445 – C5-0619/2002),

–     having regard to its resolution of 15 February 2001 on the Commission communication to
      the Council and the European Parliament: ‘The European Union and Macao: beyond
      20001,

–     having regard to the visit to Brussels and to the European Parliament in June 2001 of the
      Chief Executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region, Mr Edmundo Ho,

–     having regard to the 9th annual meeting of the Macao-European Joint Committee in
      Brussels on 18 October 2002,

–     having regard to Rule 163 of its Rules of Procedure,

–     having regard to the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common
      Security and Defence Policy (A5-0113/2003),

A.    whereas, pursuant to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao,
      signed by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987, Macao became the Macao Special
      Administrative Region of China on 20 December 1999; and whereas China has promised
      that, under its ‘one country, two systems’ formula, Macao will enjoy a high degree of
      autonomy in all matters except defence and foreign affairs, and will retain its existing
      social system, economic structure, way of life and the bulk of its existing laws,

B.    whereas the Basic Law, approved in 1993 as the mini-constitution of the Macao Special
      Administrative Region (MSAR), states that the MSAR conducts external relations in
      areas such as trade, economy, financial and monetary affairs, shipping, communications
      and tourism,




1
     OJ C 276, 1.10.2001, p. 268.

C.    whereas EU-Macao relations are based on a Trade and Cooperation Agreement which
      came into effect on 1 January 1993, and whereas this constitutes a permanent framework
      for direct dialogue between the MSAR and the EU,

D.    whereas a EU-Macao Joint Committee meets annually to oversee the operation of the
      Agreement; and whereas, since the signature of the Agreement, the EU has invested
      around EUR 1 million per year in cooperation projects with Macao; and whereas this
      illustrates the EU’s continuing commitment to Macao,

E.    whereas it is essential, following on from the final declaration issued after the ninth
      annual meeting of the EU-Macao Joint Committee, for the Commission, together with the
      MSAR, to explore innovative ways and means of enabling bilateral cooperation to be
      pursued on a broader basis in the future, taking into account in particular the substantial
      change to financial assistance brought about by the review of Council Regulation (EEC)
      No 443/92 of 25 February 1992 on financial and technical assistance to, and economic
      cooperation with, the developing countries in Asia and Latin America1 (LAA Regulation),

F.    whereas, however, despite the goodwill on both sides, direct bilateral cooperation
      between the EU and the MSAR has been declining and at present amounts to a solitary
      judicial cooperation project, implying a need for fresh impetus and greater energy in this
      area, employing new blueprints for action,

G.    whereas the EU is Macao’s third largest trading partner;

H.    whereas Macao is an autonomous member of the WTO and whereas, according to the
      WTO, its economy remains one of the most open in the world,

I.    whereas Macao, because of its history and long-standing links with Europe, in particular
      through Portugal, is well placed to act as a bridge between the European Union and the
      People’s Republic of China (PRC),

J.    whereas the governments of the MSAR and the PRC have both recently laid down and
      have been implementing a policy seeking to capitalise on Macao’s position as a hub for
      China’s relations with the entire Portuguese-speaking world; and whereas Portuguese is,
      in terms of the number of speakers, Europe’s third most important world language,

1.    Welcomes the commitment given by the Commission to continue to take a close interest
      in, as well as to maintain its obligations to, Macao after 20 December 1999 and to
      monitoring the situation in the territory by issuing annual reports; welcomes, therefore,
      the reports from the Commission for 2000 and 2001; recommends, as regards the future,
      that Parliament assess the Commission’s annual reports on a regular basis every year, at
      least until such time as bilateral cooperation between the EU and the MSAR has attained
      the momentum, breadth, and quality commensurate with the interests of all the parties;

2.    Points out that the stable and prosperous development of Macao is in the interests of both
      the PRC and the EU, and that Macao has an important role to play as a gateway to other
      regions in China and can act as a key facilitator for exchanges of all kinds between the
      EU and China; notes that Macao's links with Europe go back over 500 years;

1
     OJ L 52, 27.2.1992, p. 1.

3.     Regrets that the EU and the MSAR have not yet sufficiently intensified their links in
       various fields, and points out that traditional links should be extended even further in the
       economic and social arenas and in the cultural and political spheres;

4.     Reiterates its support for the full implementation and upholding of the Basic Law of the
       MSAR under the ‘one country, two systems’ principle; is pleased to note, therefore, that,
       three years after the handover, both the Central Government in Beijing and the MSAR
       government continue to attach great importance to this principle and that the Macao
       government continues to administer the SAR, internally and internationally, in an
       autonomous way, as set out in the Basic Law;

Institutional developments

5.     Agrees with the Commission’s assessment that, for Macao, the first year after the
       handover was primarily one of adaptation and putting its institutions into place, and the
       second year saw a consolidation of the institutions established in 2000;

6.     Draws attention to the successful first legislative elections after the handover, held in
       2001, and notes that the two-seat increase in seats elected by direct universal suffrage is a
       first step in the process of progressive democratisation;

7.     Welcomes the emphasis of the MSAR Government on the importance of consolidating
       regional cooperation, and of administrative reform; congratulates Macao on its efforts to
       re-organise certain branches of the administration, including the establishment of a
       unified Customs Service, unifying command of the police, creating a General Office of
       Civil Affairs to deal with the tasks previously carried out by the two provisional
       municipal governments; welcomes, also, the training seminars for officials aimed at
       improving the efficiency and quality of public services;

EU - Macao Relations

8.     Welcomes the launching, after Macao’s reversion to China, of a four-year cooperation
       programme in the legal field, whose overall objective is the consolidation of the Macao
       Legal System;

9.     Takes positive note of the intention expressed by Macao and Portugal to foster links for
       further cooperation between them in order to enforce the Judiciary Cooperation
       Agreement signed in 2001 in Lisbon; welcomes the successful completion in 2002 of
       projects such as the Macao-Europe Centre for Advanced Tourism Studies, the Macao
       Institute of European Studies and the Macao Services Development Programme;

10.    Endorses fully the EU Decision to grant visa-free access to Macao SAR passport-holders,
       in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the
       third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external
       borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement1; notes that
       negotiations between the EC and Macao on a re-admission agreement have begun and
       trusts that it will be possible to successfully finalise the Agreement in 2003;

1
      OJ L 81, 21.3.2001, p. 1.

11.   Reiterates its call for the Commission to appoint an EU-Macao Cooperation officer to the
      MSAR, as announced in the Commission Communication of 2000; encourages further
      and more systematic links between its parliamentarians and those of the MSAR
      Legislative Assembly and recommends, at some point, the creation of an EP-MSAR
      Friendship Group; and encourages the broadening and enhancing of links between
      academic, cultural and scientific institutions in the two regions;

Economic situation

12.   Is aware of the fact that, since the handover to China, the MSAR’s economy has
      continued to develop, and notes that, thanks to its healthy tourism sector, the MSAR’s
      economic growth rate was 7 % in 2002;

13.   Welcomes MSAR Chief Executive Mr Edmundo Ho’s announcement in his 2003 policy
      address of a major investment in public projects, expected to create 8000 jobs;

14.   Urges the MSAR government to come up with a considered policy to address the
      problems associated with the planned phasing-out of the textile quota due by 2005, as this
      sector currently employs over 22 % of the working population;

15.   Notes that the respective Chief Executives of the MSAR and HKSAR share the same
      views on the integrated development of the Pearl River Delta;

Other issues

16.   Takes note of the fact that Macao and mainland China have been discussing reinforcing
      cooperation in the fight against money laundering and terrorism;

17.   Urges the MSAR government to incorporate both the International Covenant on
      Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
      Political Rights into specific MSAR legislation as soon as possible;

General appraisal

18.   Finds that, overall, three years after the handover, the situation in the MSAR is evolving
      in a satisfactory way, maintaining Macao's specific characteristics, institutionally,
      economically and socially;

19.   Reiterates its view that the EU is in a position to make a vital contribution to safeguarding
      the high degree of autonomy enjoyed by the MSAR and its unique character, which are
      inherent to the ‘one country, two systems’ principle;

20.   Urges the Commission, working together with the MSAR in a creative approach, to
      explore the ways and means required for significant expansion in EU-Macao cooperation,
      as agreed in the final declaration of the ninth annual meeting of the EU-Macao Joint
      Committee;

21.   Urges the European Union, at all institutional levels, to continue its support for Macao
      and to maintain the Macao issue as an important point of discussion in the EU-China
      dialogue;

22.   Welcomes the decision of the MSAR Government, expressly supported by the
      Government of the PRC, to assert and consolidate Macao’s position as a centre for
      China’s links with the countries whose official language is Portuguese; points to the
      particular importance of this policy in world terms, given that it will affect China’s
      relations with countries such as Portugal, Brazil, or Cape Verde, Angola, and
      Mozambique; expresses its firm belief that the Commission, the Council, and Parliament
      will not fail to keep this new policy under the most careful review and will lend their
      support whenever common interests are shown to exist;


                                                  o
                                              o       o


23.   Instructs its President to forward the resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      Governments of the Member States, the Government and Legislative Assembly of the
      Macao SAR and the Government of the People’s Republic of China.

–    having regard to Article 8 and Article 18(h) of the Constitution of the World Health
     Organization (WHO),

–    having regard to Rules 136(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas UN Resolution 2758 was passed by the UN General Assembly on
     25 October 1971 and shifted the official recognition from the Republic of China

     (Taiwan) to the People’s Republic of China (PRC); whereas today Taiwan, while not
     being a member of the United Nations, maintains diplomatic relations with 11 of the
     193 United Nations member states, as well as with the Holy See;

B.   whereas the EU and Taiwan are like-minded partners that share the common values of
     freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; whereas Taiwan is a vibrant
     democracy, with a flourishing civil society; whereas Taiwan held peaceful and well-
     organised elections on 13 January 2024;

C.   whereas following the adoption of UN Resolution 2758, Taiwan lost its access to
     participation in multilateral forums, such as the WHO;

D.   whereas Taiwan has never been part of the PRC; whereas the Republic of China was
     established in 1912 and the PRC in 1949;

E.   whereas UN Resolution 2758 addresses the status of the PRC, but does not determine
     that the PRC enjoys sovereignty over Taiwan, nor does it make any judgement on the
     future inclusion of Taiwan in the UN or any other international organisation; whereas,
     however, the PRC continues to misinterpret UN Resolution 2758 to block Taiwan’s
     meaningful participation in international organisations and unilaterally change the status
     quo; whereas these actions highlight the PRC’s ambition to alter the existing
     multilateral international order and undermine international law, and can be seen as an
     expression of systemic rivalry;

F.   whereas the EU continues to maintain its own ‘One China’ policy, which is different
     from the PRC’s ‘One China’ principle; whereas the EU’s long-standing position has
     been to support the status quo and a peaceful resolution of differences across the
     Taiwan Strait, while encouraging dialogue and constructive engagement;

G.   whereas through their statement of 23 September 2024 the G7 members, among other
     things, underlined their support for ‘Taiwan’s meaningful participation in international
     organizations as a member where statehood is not a prerequisite and as an observer or
     guest where it is’;

H.   whereas supporting Taiwan’s participation in international organisations does not
     undermine the EU’s commitment to its ‘One China’ policy, which remains the political
     foundation of EU-China relations;

I.   whereas over the past decade the PRC has persistently tried to increase its influence
     over international institutions, using this to sideline Taiwan and prevent Taiwanese
     passport holders, including journalists, non-governmental organisation workers and
     political activists, from accessing international institutions; whereas the PRC exercises
     transnational repression by misusing extradition treaties to target Taiwanese people
     abroad and therefore put them at risk of arbitrary persecution and human rights abuses;

J.   whereas the statutes of most international organisations tasked to address global issues,
     including the WHO, the UNFCCC, Interpol and the ICAO, provide opportunities for
     entities such as Taiwan to participate without infringing on the rights of member states;

K.   whereas Taiwan has consistently demonstrated a peaceful and cooperative attitude
     globally, has significantly enhanced global developments and thus could contribute
     greatly to the work of various international organisations;

L.   whereas the PRC is a one-party state that is entirely controlled and ruled by the Chinese
     Communist Party;

M.   whereas in a speech on Taiwan’s national day of 10 October 2024, Taiwan’s President
     Lai Ching-te stated that the PRC has ‘no right to represent Taiwan’ and reiterated that
     the two sides are ‘not subordinate’ to each other; whereas the PRC has justified its
     recent military exercise by claiming that President Lai Ching-te is pursuing a separatist
     strategy;

N.   whereas on 14 October 2024 the PRC launched a large-scale military drill, named Joint
     Sword-2024B, that simulated a blockade of Taiwan; whereas during this exercise a
     record number of 153 PRC aircraft,18 warships and 17 PRC coastguard ships were
     detected around Taiwan;

O.   whereas during the exercises four formations of the PRC coastguard patrolled the island
     and briefly entered its restricted waters; whereas the very frequent deployment of the
     coastguard by the PRC in the Strait in what the PRC considers ‘law enforcement’
     missions is putting constant pressure on the Taiwanese authorities and causing a
     dangerous increase in the risk of collisions, in what is one of the most concrete
     indications of the PRC’s intention to erode the status quo; whereas the exercises
     launched on 14 October 2024 were the fourth round of large-scale war games by the
     PRC in just over two years;

P.   whereas these activities were condemned by Taiwan as an ‘unreasonable provocation’
     and are the latest in a series of war games conducted by the PRC against Taiwan;
     whereas these military drills came days after Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s new president,
     gave a speech vowing to protect Taiwan’s sovereignty in the face of challenges from the
     PRC;

Q.   whereas the median line, which was set up in a decades-old tacit agreement between
     both sides of the Taiwan Strait, was designed to reduce the risk of conflict by keeping
     the military aircraft from both sides of the Strait at a safe distance and thus prevent fatal
     miscalculations; whereas the PRC’s People’s Liberation Army violated the median line
     only four times between 1954 and 2020, but now routine incursions reflect Beijing’s
     intent to irreversibly reset long-standing benchmarks;

R.   whereas the press statements by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign
     Affairs and Security Policy and the US Department of State reaffirm that peace and
     stability in the Taiwan Strait are of strategic importance for regional and global security
     and prosperity; whereas the High Representative’s statement recalls the need to preserve
     the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, opposes any unilateral actions that change the status
     quo by force or coercion and calls on all parties to exercise restraint and avoid any
     actions that may further escalate cross-Strait tensions;

S.   whereas on 23 May 2024 the PRC launched a military drill called Joint Sword-2024A,
     just days after the inauguration of Lai Ching-te as the new President of Taiwan;

T.   whereas over the past few years the PRC has held similar military drills around Taiwan;
     whereas these military drills have increased in intensity and have been moved closer
     and closer to Taiwan’s mainland; whereas during a previous drill in August 2022 the
     PRC also fired missiles into Japan’s exclusive economic zone;

U.    whereas on top of military pressure the PRC has long been pursuing a sophisticated
      strategy of targeting Taiwan with foreign information manipulation and interference
      (FIMI), including hybrid and cyberattacks with the goal of undermining Taiwan’s
      democratic society;

V.    whereas the PRC, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, has said that it will not renounce
      the use of force to seek unification with Taiwan;

W.    whereas the PRC’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law includes the use of non-peaceful means,
      triggered by ambiguous thresholds, to achieve what the PRC calls ‘unification’ with
      Taiwan; whereas such military action is a grave threat to the security and stability of the
      entire region, with potentially dire global consequences; whereas EU and US deterrence
      is of strategic importance to dissuade the PRC from undertaking any unilateral action
      against Taiwan;

X.    whereas the PRC’s increasingly aggressive behaviour, in particular in its own
      neighbourhood, such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, poses a risk to
      regional and global security; whereas since 2019 the PRC has violated the Taiwanese
      air defence identification zone (ADIZ) with increasing regularity; whereas the PRC has
      been behaving aggressively across vast areas of the Indo-Pacific and exerting varying
      degrees of military or economic coercion, which has led to disputes with neighbours
      such as Japan, India, the Philippines and Australia;

Y.    whereas the EU has condemned the dangerous actions conducted by Chinese coastguard
      vessels against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the South China Sea on
      31 August 2024; whereas this incident is the latest in a series of actions endangering the
      safety of life at sea and violating the right to freedom of navigation and overflight in
      compliance with international law; whereas maritime security and freedom of
      navigation must be ensured in accordance with international law and, in particular,
      UNCLOS;

Z.    whereas the PRC is supporting Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, in particular
      through the export of dual-use goods to Russia and the ongoing involvement of PRC-
      based companies in sanctions evasion and circumvention;

AA. whereas as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the PRC has a
    responsibility to work for peace and stability in the region, and particularly in the
    Taiwan Strait;

AB. whereas through its 2021 strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the EU and its
    Member States increased their presence in the region, including through a higher
    military presence of certain Member States and the continued passage of military ships
    through the Taiwan Strait;

AC. whereas Taiwan is located in a strategic position in terms of trade, notably in high-tech
    supply chains; whereas the Taiwan Strait is the primary route for ships travelling from
    China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan towards Europe; whereas Taiwan dominates
    semiconductor manufacturing markets, as its producers manufacture around 50 % of the
    world’s semiconductor output; whereas the EU’s strategy for cooperation in the Indo-
    Pacific argues for increasing trade and investment cooperation with Taiwan;

AD. whereas the EU is Taiwan’s fourth largest trading partner after the PRC, the United
    States and Japan; whereas in 2022 Taiwan was the EU’s 12th largest trading partner;
    whereas the EU is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Taiwan; whereas
    Taiwanese investments in the EU remain below their potential;

AE. whereas members of the Australian Senate and of the Dutch House of Representatives
    have recently adopted motions concerning the distortion of UN Resolution 2758 by the
    PRC and called for support for Taiwan’s greater participation in multilateral
    organisations;

1.   Reiterates that Taiwan is a key EU partner and a like-minded democratic friend in the
     Indo-Pacific region; commends Taiwan and the Taiwanese people for their strong
     democracy and vibrant civil society, demonstrated once more by the peaceful and well-
     organised elections of 13 January 2024;

2.   Opposes the PRC’s constant distortion of UN Resolution 2758 and its efforts to block
     Taiwan’s participation in multilateral organisations; calls for the EU and its Member
     States to support Taiwan’s meaningful participation in relevant international
     organisations such as the WHO, the ICAO, Interpol and the UNFCCC; further calls on
     the UN Secretariat to grant Taiwanese nationals and journalists the right to access UN
     premises for visits, meetings and newsgathering activities;

3.   Strongly condemns the PRC’s unwarranted military exercises of 14 October 2024, its
     continued military provocations against Taiwan and its continued military build-up,
     which is changing the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific, and reiterates its firm
     rejection of any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait; lauds the
     restraint and disciplined reaction of the Taiwanese authorities and calls for regular
     exchanges between the EU and its Taiwanese counterparts on relevant security issues;

4.   Reaffirms its strong commitment to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait; underlines that
     any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, particularly by
     means of force or coercion, will not be accepted and will be met with a decisive and
     firm reaction;

5.   Underlines that UN Resolution 2758 takes no position on Taiwan; strongly rejects and
     refutes the PRC’s attempts to distort history and international rules;

6.   Reiterates the EU’s commitment to its ‘One China’ policy as the political foundation of
     EU-China relations; recalls that the EU’s China strategy emphasises that constructive
     cross-strait relations are part of promoting peace and security in the whole Asia-Pacific
     region and that the EU supports initiatives aimed at dialogue and confidence-building;

7.   Underlines that in Taiwan it is up to the people to democratically decide how they want
     to live and that the status quo in the Taiwan Strait must not be unilaterally changed by
     the use or threat of force;

8.   Reiterates its strong condemnation of statements by Chinese President Xi Jinping that
     the PRC will never renounce the right to use force with respect to Taiwan; underlines
     that the PRC’s use of force or threats or other highly coercive measures to achieve
     unification is incompatible with international law; expresses grave concern over the
     PRC’s use of hostile disinformation to undermine trust in Taiwan’s democracy and

      governance; reiterates its previous calls for the EU and its Member States to cooperate
      with international partners in helping to sustain democracy in Taiwan, keeping it free
      from foreign interference and threats; underlines that only Taiwan’s democratically
      elected government can represent the Taiwanese people on the international stage;

9.    Condemns the PRC’s systematic grey-zone military actions, including cyber and
      disinformation campaigns against Taiwan, and urges the PRC to halt these activities
      immediately; calls, in this regard, for cooperation between the EU and Taiwan to be
      deepened further to enhance structural cooperation on countering disinformation and
      foreign interference; welcomes the posting of a liaison officer at the European
      Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan to coordinate joint efforts to tackle
      disinformation and interference as a first important step towards deeper EU-Taiwan
      cooperation, and calls for the EU to further deepen cooperation with Taiwan in this key
      area; praises the courage of the Taiwanese people and the proportionate and dignified
      reactions of the Taiwanese authorities and institutions in the face of intensifying
      Chinese threats and activities;

10.   Firmly rejects the PRC’s economic coercion against Taiwan and other countries, as well
      as against EU Member States, and underlines that such practices are not only illegal
      under World Trade Organization rules, but that they also have a devastating effect on
      the PRC’s reputation around the world and will lead to a further loss of trust in the PRC
      as a responsible actor; stresses the independent right of the EU and its Member States to
      develop relations with Taiwan in line with their interests and shared values of
      democracy and human rights without foreign interference; calls on EU and Member
      State missions abroad to address and provide alternatives to malign PRC business
      practices, especially in the Global South;

11.   Is very concerned at the adoption of the so-called guidelines for punishing ‘diehard
      Taiwan independence separatists’ for committing crimes of secession and the
      incitement of secession jointly announced by the Supreme People’s Court, the Supreme
      People’s Procuratorate, the ministries for public security and state security and the
      justice ministry in June 2024, which could lead to harsh punishments for the crime of
      secession, up to and including the death penalty; strongly condemns the sentencing of
      one Taiwanese activist to nine years in prison in September 2024 after his arrest in the
      PRC in 2022, as well as the constant harassment of Taiwanese people working and
      living in the PRC;

12.   Is seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas; recalls the
      importance of respecting international law, including UNCLOS and, in particular, its

      response to this blatant violation of international law; recalls Taiwan’s help in
      addressing the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine
      and its continuous involvement and support for the Ukrainian government and countries
      hosting Ukrainian refugees;

15.   Highlights that the PRC’s various actions in the field of cognitive and legal warfare are
      slowly undermining the status quo, as well as intensifying grey-zone activities that are
      intended to circumvent detection, existing laws and response thresholds; calls for the
      EU to establish and enforce its redlines through its toolbox of sanctions, including
      sectoral sanctions, against hybrid activities and cyberthreats, and to coordinate strong

      countries, including France, the Netherlands and Germany; notes that these activities are
      in line with international law and calls for more cooperation and coordination with
      regional partners in order to increase freedom of navigation operations in the region;

–    having regard to Rules 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas since 1999, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has engaged in systematic

     Article 36 of the PRC’s Constitution stipulates that its citizens must enjoy freedom of
     religious belief;

B.   whereas it is documented that thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have died as a
     result of the CCP’s persecution since 1999; whereas practitioners are frequently

C.   whereas on 12 May 2023 Falun Gong practitioners Mr Ding Yuande and his wife

–    having regard to Rules 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
     should be at the centre of the EU’s relations with China, in line with the EU’s
     commitment to uphold these values in its external action and China’s commitment to
     adhere to them in its own development and international cooperation;

B.   whereas since 2020 China has pursued a very strict zero-COVID policy featuring mass
     testing and ad hoc and long-lasting lockdowns seriously curtailing people’s freedom and
     rights;

C.   whereas these severe restrictions have led to frequent and protracted lockdowns,
     massive and systematic testing requirements and quarantining, and disproportionate and
     severe limitations to freedom of movement inside China; whereas these restrictions


1    OJ L 410 I, 7.12.2020, p. 1.

     have also led to supply shortages of essential goods, including food, limited access to
     healthcare and an increase in youth unemployment in the People’s Republic of China;

D.   whereas in the days and weeks before the widespread protests erupted, there had been
     high levels of tension in some factories, such as the Foxconn factories, from where large
     numbers of workers fled in order to escape radical and total factory lockdowns
     following COVID outbreaks inside the production sites and in protest against the
     recurrent non-payment of bonuses during lockdowns; whereas factory protests turned
     violent and social media videos showed workers being beaten by the police;

E.   whereas due to the strict enforcement of the lockdowns, entire buildings, including
     emergency exists, were at times sealed off; whereas on 24 November 2022 a fire broke
     out in a residential building in Urumqi, Xinjiang, a city where a continuous lockdown
     had been in place for over 100 days, in which at least ten people lost their lives; whereas
     local sources and numerous social media posts have suggested a much higher death toll1
     of up to 40 casualties; whereas inhabitants of this building were allegedly locked in
     their apartments and firefighters were delayed, probably because of restrictions imposed
     under the zero-COVID policy;

F.   whereas on 26 November 2022, for the first time since the Tiananmen Square protests
     in 1989, people took to the streets in Beijing, Shanghai and other major Chinese cities
     and municipalities and reportedly in more than 100 universities to protest against
     China’s zero-COVID policy and denounce the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarian
     rule; whereas protesters quickly adopted a blank sheet of paper as a symbol to express
     their anger over the suppression of free speech;

G.   whereas the police, after initially showing restraint, quickly began to break up crowds
     and carry out widespread arrests in several cities; whereas in Shanghai, for instance,
     police used pepper spray to dispel around 300 protesters who had gathered; whereas
     posts about the protest on China’s social media platforms were deleted immediately in
     an effort to suppress criticism; whereas Chinese state media has so far simply avoided
     covering the protests;

H.   whereas some protesters are calling for President Xi Jinping to resign, which constitutes
     an unprecedented challenge to the country’s current leadership;

I.   whereas women have been at the forefront of these protests; whereas women’s rights in
     China have been deteriorating in recent years; whereas studies have shown that
     lockdowns increase the risk of gender-based domestic violence;

J.   whereas reports have been made of a strong police presence and interventions leading to
     numerous arrests of peaceful protesters; whereas, according to various human rights
     organisations, authorities have also interfered with the protesters’ right to legal
     representation, with some lawyers being warned by local authorities not to take on
     cases;

K.   whereas Article 35 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China proclaims that
     ‘citizens of the People’s Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of

1    https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/01/china/china-protests-urumqi-fire-deaths-covid-dst-
     intl-hnk/index.html.

     assembly, of association, of procession, and of demonstration’; whereas the liberties
     enshrined in this article are being constantly violated;

L.   whereas, since President Xi Jinping assumed power in March 2013, the human rights
     situation in China has drastically deteriorated; whereas the Chinese Government has
     stepped up its hostility against human rights and the rule of law; whereas China’s illegal
     mass surveillance and monitoring of its citizens has been expanded;

M.   whereas, in recent years, the Chinese authorities have tightened online censorship, in
     particular since the outbreak of COVID-19; whereas the Chinese authorities and police
     have assembled one of the world’s most sophisticated surveillance systems by gaining
     access to powerful facial recognition software and technology in order to heavily
     restrict fundamental freedoms in a generalised fashion, or even massively violate human
     rights; whereas there are concerns that due to these mass surveillance and facial
     recognition technologies, the security apparatus will prosecute demonstrators at a later
     time;

N.   whereas, according to recent reports, the Chinese authorities have implemented the
     highest ‘emergency response’ level of media censorship in the context of the recent
     outbreak of protests; whereas social media platforms have played an active and
     instrumental role in disseminating content across the country; whereas security forces
     have also stopped citizens on the street, inspected their electronic devices and forced
     them to delete certain applications, content and photos related to the protests; whereas,
     following the outbreak of the protests, the Chinese authorities immediately began to
     track, on a massive scale, messaging applications, social media and mobile phone data
     they consider suspicious, as well as the use of virtual private networks, in order to
     identify, intimidate and harass people allegedly organising and participating in the
     protests;

O.   whereas, in recent years, the Chinese authorities have dismantled civil society groups
     and imprisoned many independent activists, making large-scale protests extremely
     difficult to carry out; whereas, in recent months, sporadic protests have taken place in
     response to the COVID-19 policy, economic hardship, censorship and President Xi’s
     expanded powers, in China and by Chinese nationals outside the country;

P.   whereas China engages in cross-border repression and surveillance through various
     activities ranging from espionage, cyber-attacks, physical attacks and the issuance of
     Red Notices through INTERPOL to ‘offshore police stations’ on EU territory;

Q.   whereas, in a nationally coordinated move, students were sent home from universities
     one month early in order to prevent them from continuing to participate in organised
     protests;

R.   whereas some Chinese diplomats have engaged in violence and threats towards Chinese
     students and opponents abroad, demanding that they ‘resist distorting and discrediting
     China’s epidemic prevention and control policies’;

S.   whereas China has been pursuing the systemic persecution of the Uyghur people and
     other ethnic minorities, human rights defenders, social activists, religious groups,
     journalists and protesters against injustices, as well as the ever-increasing repression of
     all dissenting and opposition voices; whereas the loss of life in the Urumqi fire adds

     another tragedy to the human rights atrocities taking place in the Xinjiang Uyghur
     Autonomous Region;

1.   Strongly condemns the Chinese Government-led reaction to the peaceful protests and
     the persecution of the peaceful protesters across the People’s Republic of China;
     expresses its condolences to and stands in solidarity with the victims of the Urumqi fire
     and their family members; calls upon the Chinese Government to be transparent about
     the number of victims and the circumstances under which they died; calls for a prompt,
     effective and thorough investigation of the Urumqi fire;

2.   Expresses its solidarity with the people of China in their fight for fundamental
     freedoms; condemns the persecution of the peaceful protesters; urges all police forces to
     respond in line with international standards, including the United Nations Basic
     Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials;

3.   Expresses its serious concerns about human rights violations in China, including in the
     context of its zero-COVID policy;

4.   Notes that all the victims of the Urumqi fire are of Uyghur ethnicity1, thus deepening
     the suffering of this ethnic group which has fallen victim to systematic human rights
     atrocities taking place in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which the European
     Parliament has recognised as constituting crimes against humanity and representing a
     serious risk of genocide2;

5.   Condemns in the strongest terms the fact that freedom of expression, freedom of
     assembly and freedom of the press and social media are severely restricted in China;
     calls on the Chinese Government to ensure the freedom of expression, association,
     assembly, press and media, as enshrined in the Chinese Constitution and international
     human rights law;

6.   Strongly condemns the violent assault and detention of a foreign journalist covering
     these protests; recalls that the freedom of the press is a fundamental principle and an
     essential pillar of any democracy; calls on China to ensure that all journalists are able to
     conduct their work freely and without impediments or fear of reprisals, as provided for
     by Chinese law; stresses that the freedom of the press and media should be ensured;
     urges the Chinese authorities to stop interfering with, harassing and intimidating
     lawyers and legal professionals, human rights defenders and others who openly express
     concern about the protesters or who defend the right to peaceful protest;

7.   Urges China to put an immediate end to the suppression and intimidation of peaceful
     protesters and to guarantee fundamental rights for everyone; calls on the Chinese
     authorities to immediately release all protesters wrongfully detained; demands that all
     data recently collected about peaceful protesters be deleted and not used in any future
     cases; requests that family members of all those deprived of liberty be notified of their
     whereabouts and the charges brought against them;

8.   Recognises the challenge of designing a COVID-19 policy with the right balance
     between protecting public health and protecting rights and freedoms; recalls the

2    Texts adopted, P9_TA(2022)0237.

      importance of proportionality; notes the recent lifting of some of the most oppressive
      COVID-19 restrictions in China;

9.    Notes the fact that the protest movement has united people from very different
      backgrounds and has taken place nationwide; highlights the remarkable fact that inter-
      ethnic solidarity has been expressed with the victims of the fire in Xinjiang, since
      China’s Han population has not previously reacted significantly to the terrible fate of
      the Uyghurs over the past six years;

10.   Calls on the Chinese and local authorities to put an end to the repression of Uyghurs and
      recalls that the Uyghurs in the region have been subjected to intense surveillance, forced
      labour, involuntary sterilisations and birth prevention measures, among other rights
      abuses, which amount to crimes again humanity and represent a serious risk of
      genocide; welcomes, in this regard, the Commission proposal to ban products made
      using forced labour from entering the EU market;

11.   Strongly condemns the extensive use of mass surveillance and the current censorship of
      social networks; urges the Chinese authorities to put an end to these violations of
      fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of expression and to the manipulation of
      information on social networks;

12.   Condemns the fact that Chinese technology companies TikTok and Tencent are working
      with the Chinese Government to gather evidence on the identity of protesters to enable
      their arrest and are censoring the internet; calls on European pension funds to divest
      from Chinese companies that undermine human rights;

13.   Expresses its deep concern over the conduct of Apple Inc. in China during the protests,
      as it effectively worked hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party to suppress
      the dissemination of footage of the peaceful anti-lockdown protests by disabling the
      AirDrop function on its devices in China; notes that this function had enabled the
      protesters to share footage and organise the protests without using Wi-Fi, which is
      under constant surveillance and control by the Chinese Communist Party; stresses that
      the fact that companies can be held hostage by the Chinese Communist Party and enable
      ruthless human rights violations should be a wake-up call for western governments to
      put forward legislation that would encourage western companies to double down on
      their efforts to reshore production from China;

14.   Reiterates its concerns about the fact that the Chinese authorities did not allow UN High
      Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, during her visit to China, to have
      full access to independent civil society organisations and human rights defenders;
      reiterates its call on the Chinese authorities to allow the same free, meaningful and
      unhindered access for independent journalists, international observers and investigative
      bodies, including, in particular, the mandate holders of the UN Human Rights Council
      Special Procedures and the EU Special Representative for Human Rights; supports the
      call issued by 50 United Nations human rights experts for the establishment of a special
      mandate at the UN Human Rights Council to monitor and report on human rights
      conditions across China; calls for the EU and its Member States to continue to work
      with like-minded partners towards the establishment of an investigative mechanism at
      the UN Human Rights Council to monitor, assess and publicly report on serious human
      rights violations across China;

15.   Urges the EU and the Member States to provide protection and support to human rights
      and democracy activists in China, in particular by reaching out to the local and national
      authorities and applying in full the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders and
      other relevant EU policies, including the new EU Action Plan on Human Rights and
      Democracy; welcomes the continuation of the established bilateral EU-US Dialogue on
      China, in particular the statement that ‘the United States and European Union have
      never been more aligned on our strategic outlooks’;

16.   Calls on the EU and other international organisations to monitor and assess how China’s
      responses to these protests align with international human rights standards and its
      obligations under international human rights law; stresses the importance of the EU
      Delegation in Beijing continuing to monitor the detention of peaceful protesters and any
      trials of those being prosecuted for exercising their right to freedom of peaceful
      assembly and expression, applying in full the EU Guidelines on Human Rights
      Defenders and other relevant EU policies;

17.   Calls on VP/HR Josep Borrell to follow up, with concrete steps, the recent European
      Council discussions by intensifying discussions at the level of Member States’ foreign
      affairs ministers; calls on the EEAS and the Commission to set up a permanent
      discussion on China under the Asia-Oceania Working Party; welcomes the decision to
      extend the sanctions in response to human rights violations in Xinjiang until 8
      December 2023; reiterates its call for additional EU sanctions targeting Chinese
      officials and entities responsible for crimes against humanity; encourages EU Member
      State authorities to consider prosecuting Chinese officials deemed responsible for
      crimes against humanity, on the basis of the principle of universal jurisdiction;

18.   Expresses its deep concerns about the recent revelations regarding the presence of
      Chinese overseas police service stations in numerous EU Member States and around the
      world; calls on the Commission, the Council and national law enforcement agencies to
      ensure, as a matter of urgency, good coordination in order to shed light on these
      practices, take appropriate action and close down all Chinese overseas police service
      stations; calls on the EU and its Member States, in coordination with like-minded
      partners, to identify and close down any avenues facilitating China’s campaigns of
      transnational repression, in particular against members of its diaspora;

19.   Urges the Member States to end all their extradition agreements with China and Hong
      Kong; urges further the Member States to exercise caution when cooperating in
      international law enforce forums such as INTERPOL and the United Nations Office on
      Drugs and Crime; calls further on the Member States to properly ensure the security of
      Chinese refugees under their jurisdiction in order to avoid their capture or their being
      ‘persuaded to return’ or lured into a non-EU country from which they could easily be
      repatriated to China;

20.   Calls on all members of the international community and all stakeholders to address the
      issue of freedom of expression when engaging with the People’s Republic of China;
      welcomes the fact that European Council President Charles Michel raised the issue of
      the protests with Xi Jinping; calls for unconditional readiness to resume the EU-China
      Human Rights Dialogue, which has not taken place for more than three years; also notes
      that all European leaders should clearly communicate to the Chinese authorities the
      EU’s determination to react to an escalation of the repression against protesters by

      raising the issue in international organisations and to possibly impose additional
      sanctions, if necessary;

21.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign
      Affairs and Security Policy, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the
      United Nations Secretary-General, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
      Rights, the Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of China, and all
      ambassadors of the People’s Republic of China in EU Member States.

–    having regard to the statement by G7 foreign ministers of 3 August 2022 on preserving
     peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,

–    having regard to the speech given by VP/HR Josep Borrell at the 29th ASEAN Regional
     Forum on 5 August 2022,

–    having regard to the US-Australia-Japan Trilateral Strategic Dialogue of 5 August 2022,

–    having regard to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg’s statement of 4 August
     2022,

–    having regard to Rule 132(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas the EU and Taiwan are like-minded partners that share the common values of
     freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law; whereas the EU continues to
     maintain its principled ‘One China’ policy position;

B.   whereas between 4 and 10 August 2022, the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
     escalated its long-standing military intimidation against Taiwan to an unprecedented
     level following the visit of 2 and 3 August 2022 by the Speaker of the United States
     House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and launched large-scale live-fire military
     exercises in seven designated areas surrounding Taiwan; whereas the exercises included
     the use of up to 11 ballistic missiles, of which at least five flew over Taiwan; whereas
     these military drills constituted a virtual blockade of Taiwan’s sea and air space;

C.   whereas five of the PRC’s ballistic missiles landed in the Japanese exclusive economic
     zone (EEZ);

D.   whereas the full-scale military exercises were coupled with intense cyber-attacks
     against the Taiwanese authorities and private sector; whereas the PRC’s continued
     military belligerence poses a grave threat to the status quo and may lead to dangerous,
     even unintended, escalation with a severe impact on global stability and peace,
     including for the EU;

E.   whereas the PRC appears to be seeking to perpetuate its overly aggressive actions,
     trying to erode the status quo in the Taiwan Strait;

F.   whereas since 2019 the PRC has violated the Taiwanese air defence identification zone
     (ADIZ) with increasing regularity; whereas the PRC has been behaving aggressively
     across a vast areas of the Indo-Pacific and exerting varying degrees of military or
     economic coercion, which has led to disputes with neighbours such as Japan, India, the
     Philippines and Australia;

G.   whereas in response to the renewed provocations by the PRC, Taiwan has announced
     that it will increase its military budget by 13,9 % year-on-year, to a record
     TWD 586,3 billion (EUR 19,5 billion);

H.   whereas Australia and Japan, together with the United States, in a joint statement
     expressed ‘concern about [the PRC’s] recent actions that gravely affect international
     peace and stability’ and urged the PRC ‘to immediately cease the military exercises’;
     whereas the G7 foreign ministers have thoroughly criticised the PRC’s aggressive
     actions;

I.   whereas after the visit of the US Congressional delegation led by Speaker Pelosi, the
     PRC suspended talks and cooperation with the United States in eight different areas,
     including dialogues on military matters and climate change;

J.   whereas Taiwan has in recent years hosted numerous visits from lawmakers, including
     those from EU Member States and one Vice-President of the European Parliament;
     whereas such visits in the framework of parliamentary diplomacy are common practice
     in democracies;

K.   whereas on 9 October 2021, the PRC’s President Xi Jinping vowed to pursue
     ‘reunification’ with Taiwan by supposedly peaceful means, falsely claiming that biggest
     obstacle to it was the so-called ‘Taiwan independence’ forces; whereas this rhetoric is
     not supported by the PRC’s actions; whereas some PRC diplomats even threatened so-
     called ‘re-education’ of Taiwanese people after ‘reunification’;

L.   whereas the PRC’s recently published white paper entitled ‘The Taiwan Question and
     China’s Reunification in the New Era’ removed previous reassurances offered to
     Taiwan about its future status after ‘reunification’, such as not stationing PRC troops or
     administrative personnel on the island;

M.   whereas the PRC imposed massive economic sanctions and pressure on Lithuania after
     it agreed to the opening of a Taiwanese representative office in Lithuania, as well as
     plans to open a Lithuanian trade representative office in Taipei; whereas Parliament
     strongly maintains the right of all EU Member States to pursue such relations with
     Taiwan;

N.   whereas Taiwan has aligned itself with EU sanctions against Russia and whereas both
     the Taiwanese authorities as well as its people have made significant donations to
     Ukrainian refugees;

O.   whereas Taiwan is located in a strategic position in terms of trade; whereas the Taiwan
     Strait is the primary route for ships travelling from China, Japan, South Korea and
     Taiwan towards Europe; whereas the EU remains the largest source of foreign direct
     investment (FDI) in Taiwan; whereas there is considerable potential for increasing
     Taiwan’s FDI in the EU; whereas Taiwan dominates the semiconductor manufacturing
     markets, as its producers manufacture around 50 % of the world’s semiconductor
     output; whereas the EU’s Indo-Pacific strategy argues for increasing trade and
     investment cooperation with Taiwan and advocates stabilising tensions in the South
     China Sea and the Taiwan Strait;

P.   whereas, at the EU-China Summit on 1 April 2022, the EU recalled the PRC’s
     responsibility, as a global actor and as a permanent member of the United Nations
     Security Council, to work for peace and stability in the region and particularly in the
     Taiwan Strait;

Q.   whereas the EU is committed to using every available channel to encourage initiatives
     aimed at promoting dialogue, cooperation and confidence-building across both sides of
     the Taiwan Strait; whereas these new developments have reinforced the urgent need for
     EU engagement to contribute to lowering regional tensions as an instability factor;

1.   Strongly condemns the PRC’s military exercises which began in the Taiwan Strait on 2
     August 2022 and which reached an unprecedented level of intensity, and calls on the
     Government of the PRC to refrain from any measures which could destabilise the
     Taiwan Strait and regional security;

2.   Underlines that the status quo in the Taiwan Strait must not be unilaterally changed and
     insists on opposing the use or threat of force;

3.   Reaffirms the international community’s commitment to maintaining the rules-based
     international order, peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the region;
     reiterates the EU’s commitment to the ‘One China’ policy as the political foundation of
     EU-China relations; recalls that the EU China strategy emphasises that constructive
     cross-strait relations are part of promoting peace and security in the whole Asia-Pacific
     region and that the EU supports initiatives aimed at dialogue and confidence-building;
     is convinced that the PRC’s provocative actions against Taiwan and in the South China
     Sea must have consequences for EU-China relations, and that the possibility of
     contingency planning must be considered;

4.   Expresses its firm solidarity with the people of Taiwan; applauds the Taiwanese
     authorities and political leaders for their measured and responsible reaction to the
     PRC’s provocations;

5.   Underlines that on the democratic island of Taiwan, it is up to the people to decide how
     they want to live;

6.   Reiterates the importance of respecting international law, in particular the UN
     Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and its provisions on the obligation to
     settle disputes by peaceful means and on maintaining the freedom of navigation and
     overflight;

7.   Welcomes the clear condemnation of the PRC’s military exercises by EU Member
     States as well as partners in the region and underlines that our unity is key in order to
     deter any aggression by the PRC and maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait;

8.   Is extremely concerned by the ballistic missiles that have been fired over Taiwan, which
     have landed in the exclusive economic zone of Japan, threatening the stability of the
     region and Japan’s national security; welcomes the spokesperson of the Japanese
     Government’s statements calling for a genuine dialogue to solve the issues concerning
     Taiwan peacefully; expresses its sympathy for and offers its full support to Japan, and
     stresses in this regard the need for democracies in the region to continue supporting
     Taiwan in the face of the PRC’s sabre-rattling, as peace and stability in the region are in
     everyone’s interest;

9.   Urges the PRC to immediately stop all actions and intrusions into the Taiwanese ADIZ
     and the airspace violations above Taiwan’s outer islands, restore the full respect of the

      Taiwan Strait’s median line, and stop all other grey-zone military actions including
      cyber and disinformation campaigns;

10.   Condemns the PRC’s decision to suspend various political dialogues with the United
      States, including on climate and security matters, and urges the PRC’s leadership to
      return to diplomatic standards in order to avoid the risk of miscalculations and mistakes
      which could have catastrophic consequences;

11.   Firmly rejects the PRC’s economic coercion against Taiwan and other democracies in
      its region, as well as against EU Member States, and underlines that such practices are
      not only illegal under World Trade Organization rules, but that they also have a
      devastating effect on the PRC’s reputation around the world and will lead to a further
      loss of trust in the PRC as a partner;

12.   Calls for the EU to assume a stronger role when it comes to the situation in the Taiwan
      Strait and the Indo-Pacific as a whole in line with its own Indo-Pacific strategy; calls for
      the further deepening of our strategic relations with like-minded partners in the region,
      in particular Japan and Australia;

13.   Calls on EU Member States to increase their economic and diplomatic presence
      throughout the Indo-Pacific region, including in Taiwan, and recalls that the world’s
      strategic and economic centre of gravity is shifting to this region, and that the EU
      therefore has a clear interest in forging a clear and credible EU-level approach to the
      Indo-Pacific;

14.   Calls again for the EU to enhance the existing partnership with Taiwan so as to promote
      common values and principles, including by pursuing a resilient supply chain agreement
      and a bilateral investment agreement (BIA), which would help protect the interests of
      the EU as a whole and of its Member States;

15.   Welcomes the recently announced plans by Lithuania to open a trade representative
      office in Taipei in the autumn of 2022; calls on other Member States who do not yet
      operate a trade office in Taiwan to follow this example and strengthen their relations
      with Taiwan; calls on the PRC to revoke its unjustified sanctions against Lithuanian
      officials; condemns the PRC’s trade restrictions;

16.   Calls on the Commission to change the name of the European Economic and Trade
      Office in Taipei in order to reflect the broad scope of our ties;

17.   Stresses that Taiwan is crucial for the global supply chain of key high-tech sectors,
      notably semiconductors, and calls on the Commission and the European External
      Action Service (EEAS) to develop a strategy for resilience and swiftly start working on
      a resilient supply chain agreement with Taiwan with a view to addressing respective
      vulnerabilities in a mutually beneficial manner and aiming at preserving Taiwan’s
      security by strengthening its ‘silicon shield’;

18.   Encourages increased economic, scientific, cultural and political interaction between the
      EU and Taiwan including at the most senior levels possible, so as to fully reflect the
      dynamic, multi-faceted and close cooperation between the EU and Taiwan as like-
      minded partners;

19.   Calls on the EEAS and the Commission to consider connectivity projects with Pacific
      island states and co-investment in partnerships between the EU’s Global Gateway and
      Taiwan’s New Southbound Policy with a view to fostering trade and political
      relationships as well as stability in the Indo-Pacific region;

20.   Reiterates its previous call on the Commission to launch, without delay, an impact
      assessment, public consultation and scoping exercise on a BIA with the Taiwanese
      authorities in preparation for negotiations to deepen bilateral economic ties;

21.   Recommends further deepening cooperation between the EU and Taiwan to enhance
      structural cooperation on countering disinformation and foreign interference;
      recommends posting a liaison officer at the European Economic and Trade Office to
      coordinate joint efforts on tackling disinformation and interference;

22.   Recognises that gestures of support, such as parliamentary visits, are valuable and
      believes that they can contribute to deterrence if paired with substantive cooperation in
      other fields; underlines its intention to send future official parliamentary delegations to
      Taiwan; welcomes the fact that an official invitation to visit the European Parliament
      was extended to Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan during the recent visit of European
      Parliament Vice-President Beer to Taiwan; intends to pursue actions such as the
      organisation of an EU-Taiwan parliamentary week;

23.   Salutes Taiwan’s commitment to stand with Ukraine in the face of Russia’s brutal and
      unjustified aggression;

24.   Recalls the importance of strengthening EU-Taiwan dialogue by deepening relations
      with local actors, including civil society, and fostering exchanges with Taiwanese media
      organisations, and stresses that such strengthened exchange will help to improve the
      EU’s profile and visibility inside Taiwan and contribute to joint efforts to address the
      threat of disinformation that both sides are increasingly confronted with;

25.   Strongly advocates for Taiwan’s meaningful participation as an observer in meetings,
      mechanisms and activities of international bodies such as the World health
      Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Criminal
      Police Organization (Interpol), and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change;

26.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign
      Affairs and Security Policy, and the governments and legislatures of Taiwan, the
      People’s Republic of China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, the
      Philippines, Russia and Ukraine, and the governments and parliaments of the Member
      States.

Kong
European Parliament resolution of 7 July 2022 on the arrest of Cardinal Zen and the
trustees of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund in Hong Kong (2022/2751(RSP))


The European Parliament,

–    having regard to its resolutions of 20 January 2022 on violations of fundamental
     freedoms in Hong Kong1, of 8 July 2021 on Hong Kong, notably the case of Apple

     (JOIN(2022)0016),

–    having regard to the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National

–    having regard to the Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the European
     Union on the Chief Executive election in Hong Kong held on 8 May 2022,

–    having regard to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the

–    having regard to the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom and
     the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the question of Hong Kong of
     19 December 1984, also known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration, registered by the
     Chinese and British Governments at the United Nations on 12 June 1985,

–    having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948,

2    OJ C 99, 1.3.2022, p. 178.
3    OJ C 456, 10.11.2021, p. 242.

–    having regard to Rules 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
     should be at the centre of the EU’s relations with China, in line with the EU’s
     commitment to upholding these values in its external action and China’s commitment to
     adhering to them in its own development and international cooperation;

B.   whereas on 11 and 12 May 2022, the police arrested the trustees of the 612
     Humanitarian Relief Fund in Hong Kong, which provides humanitarian and financial
     support to persons injured, arrested or threatened during the Anti-Extradition Law
     Amendment Bill protests – retired Roman Catholic bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen, former
     legislator Cyd Ho, singer-activist Denise Ho, academic Hui Po-Keung and senior
     barrister Margaret Ng – on charges of collusion with foreign forces (Article 29 of the
     National Security Law);

C.   whereas some 10 000 people have been arrested by the Hong Kong authorities since the
     2019 protests; whereas 2 500 people have been prosecuted and more than 1 100 people
     have been convicted; whereas as of 28 March 2022, nearly 200 people had been arrested
     under the National Security Law; whereas at the start of 2022, there were 721 political
     prisoners in Hong Kong;

D.   whereas the 24th annual report of the Commission and the High Representative
     covering the political and economic developments in the Hong Kong Special
     Administrative Region (SAR) in 2021 concludes that the space for civil society is
     continuing to shrink;

E.   whereas the review by the UN Human Rights Committee of Hong Kong’s compliance
     with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is ongoing and is expected
     to be finalised in July 2022;

1.   Condemns the arrests of Cardinal Joseph Zen, one of the strongest advocates of the
     city’s pro-democracy movement, and of the other four trustees of the 612 Humanitarian
     Relief Fund in Hong Kong, which constitute an attack on the freedoms guaranteed in
     the Hong Kong Basic Law, including the freedom of religion or belief, particularly
     following the closure of over 60 civil society groups, and are symptomatic of the
     continued efforts of the People’s Republic of China to systematically destroy the last
     remnants of Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms and to suppress the pro-democracy
     movement; believes that the arrest is a clear demonstration of John Lee Ka-Chiu’s
     stated intention to oppress all critical voices even more strongly and to further intensify
     the crackdown;

2.   Calls on the authorities of the Hong Kong SAR to drop all charges against Cardinal Zen
     and the other four trustees of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund – Cyd Ho, Denise Ho,
     Hui Po-Keung and Margaret Ng – and to release Cyd Ho; urges the authorities of the
     Hong Kong SAR to allow the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund to resume its financial,
     legal and humanitarian support of those who benefited from it;

3.   Calls on the Member States to step up efforts to implement the Council conclusions of
     July 2020, including ‘lifeboat schemes’ for Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and
     political leaders, for example by facilitating the issuing of emergency visas and
     providing temporary shelter; calls on the Vatican to give full support to Cardinal Zen

      and other religious leaders who face persecution or the risk of detention under the
      national security regime in Hong Kong; further calls on the Vatican to strengthen its
      diplomatic efforts and its leverage on the Chinese authorities, and to demand that all
      charges against Cardinal Zen be dropped and an end to persecution and human rights
      violations;

4.    Underlines that, 25 years since the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, when the Chinese
      authorities assumed sovereignty while promising to respect the city’s freedoms and
      rights protected in the Basic Law, and two years since the introduction of the so-called
      National Security Law in Hong Kong, the People’s Republic of China is in continued
      breach of its obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration to uphold Hong
      Kong’s high degree of autonomy under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ model, the
      rule of law, and basic human rights as enshrined in the Hong Kong Basic Law and in
      line with its domestic and international obligations as a signatory of the International
      Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;

5.    Urges the Chinese authorities to repeal the National Security Law completely and to
      recommit to upholding the Hong Kong Basic Law, which guarantees freedom of
      association, freedom of assembly, freedom of expression and freedom of religion and
      belief;

6.    Stresses that the election of John Lee was held in blatant violation of key democratic
      principles and political pluralism and in disregard of the right of the citizens of Hong
      Kong to universal suffrage; stresses that Beijing’s electoral reforms and the fact that
      former Security Minister and police officer John Lee was handpicked for the role of
      Chief Executive show that Hong Kong’s Government is no longer independent from
      Beijing under the previous ‘One Country, Two Systems’ model and that all political
      opposition has been oppressed;

7.    Deplores the decision by the Hong Kong authorities to ban, for the third consecutive
      year, the annual 4 June Tiananmen Square vigil;

8.    Reiterates its call for the Council to introduce targeted sanctions under the EU Global
      Human Rights Sanctions Regime (the EU’s Magnitsky-style sanctions) against John
      Lee and all other Hong Kong and PRC officials responsible for the ongoing human
      rights crackdown in the city; further reiterates its urgent call for the remaining 10 EU
      Member States who have not done so to suspend active extradition treaties with the
      PRC and Hong Kong;

9.    Reiterates its call for the European External Action Service (EEAS) to ensure adequate
      resources for the European Union Office to Hong Kong (EU Office) so that it can
      continue conducting and adequately stepping up trial observation, prison visits and
      human rights monitoring, by releasing public statements, appointing a human rights
      focal point among its staff for human rights defenders and raising their cases with the
      authorities at all levels; calls on the EEAS and the EU Office to report regularly on the
      most prominent trials, as well as on the evolution of the human rights situation in Hong
      Kong more generally;

10.   Urges the EU Office and the diplomatic personnel of the Member States to do
      everything they can to provide the human rights activists in Hong Kong with all the
      support they need and to help safeguard their rights, notably by visiting political

      prisoners in jail, issuing emergency visas and providing temporary shelter in the
      Member States to those fleeing Hong Kong; deplores the climate of fear that the
      National Security Law has generated among Hong Kong civil society, including as a
      result of the introduction of the arbitrary offence of ‘collusion with foreign and external
      forces’;

11.   Supports the call issued by 50 United Nations human rights experts to establish a
      special mandate at the UN Human Rights Council to monitor and report on human
      rights conditions across China, including Hong Kong;

12.   Reiterates its call for the Commission and the Member States to review the agreement
      between the EU and Hong Kong/China on cooperation and mutual administrative
      assistance in customs matters, the status of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office
      in Brussels, and Hong Kong’s seat in the World Trade Organization;

13.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign
      Affairs and Security Policy, the Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of
      China, the EU Office in Hong Kong, all consular offices of the EU Member States in
      Hong Kong, the Holy See and the Chief Executive and Legislative Council of the Hong
      Kong Special Administrative Region.

The human rights situation in Xinjiang, including the Xinjiang police files
European Parliament resolution of 9 June 2022 on the human rights situation in
Xinjiang, including the Xinjiang police files (2022/2700(RSP))


The European Parliament,

–    having regard to its previous resolutions and reports on the situation in China, in
     particular those of 17 December 2020 on forced labour and the situation of the Uyghurs
     in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region1 and of 19 December 2019 on the situation
     of the Uyghurs in China (China Cables)2,

–    having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948,

–    having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 16
     December 1966,

–    having regard to Council Regulation (EU) 2020/19983 and to Council Decision (CFSP)
     2020/1999 of 7 December 20204 concerning restrictive measures against serious human
     rights violations and abuses,

–    having regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989,

–    having regard to Article 36 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, which
     guarantees all citizens the right to freedom of religious belief, and to Article 4 thereof,
     which upholds the rights of ethnic minorities,

–    having regard to Rules 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
     should be at the centre of the EU’s relations with China, in line with the EU’s
     commitment to uphold these values in its external action and China’s commitment to
     adhere to them in its own development and international cooperation;

3    OJ L 410 I, 7.12.2020, p. 1.
4    OJ L 410 I, 7.12.2020, p. 13.

B.   whereas the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and a number of
     international media outlets, including the BBC, Spain’s El Pais, France’s Le Monde and
     Germany’s Der Spiegel, were able to examine the Xinjiang police files;

C.   whereas the responsible Chinese authorities have denied the allegations of massive and
     structural human rights violations in Xinjiang;

D.   whereas the Xinjiang police files document in detail – and, for the first time, with
     numerous photographs – the dimensions of the systematic, brutal and arbitrary
     repression in the Uyghur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang;

E.   whereas this material demonstrates the informed role, active support and direct
     involvement of the Central Government in Beijing, including Xi Jinping and Li
     Keqiang, and of leading Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region officials in directing the
     mass internment policy in Xinjiang; whereas the documents also point to President Xi
     Jinping’s informed and active support for Xinjiang’s ‘re-education’, ‘strike hard’ and
     ‘de-extremification’ campaigns, as well as for continued spending on additional
     detention facilities and staff to manage the influx of detainees;

F.   whereas the Uyghur Tribunal and other credible, independent investigative bodies and
     research organisations have concluded that China’s serious and systemic human rights
     violations against the Uyghurs and other ethnic Turkic peoples amount to torture,
     crimes against humanity and genocide1; whereas the US Government and legislative
     bodies in the US, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Lithuania,
     Czechia and Ireland have made similar determinations;

G.   whereas since 2017, various NGOs have repeatedly reported that China has been
     pursuing the mass detention of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim
     ethnic groups in Xinjiang;

H.   whereas the atrocities against the Uyghurs have to be seen in the context of China’s
     wider repressive and aggressive internal and external policies;

1.   Condemns in the strongest possible terms the fact that the Uyghur community in the
     People’s Republic of China has been systematically oppressed by brutal measures,
     including mass deportation, political indoctrination, family separation, restrictions on
     religious freedom, cultural destruction and the extensive use of surveillance;

2.   States that the credible evidence about birth prevention measures and the separation of
     Uyghur children from their families amount to crimes against humanity and represent a
     serious risk of genocide; calls on the Chinese authorities to cease all government-
     sponsored programmes of forced labour and mass forced sterilisation and to put an

      immediate end to any measures aimed at preventing births in the Uyghur population,
      including forced abortions or sanctions for birth control violations;

3.    Expresses its serious concerns about the excessive and arbitrary prison sentences
      handed down as a result of allegations of terrorism or extremism which, according to
      the Xinjiang police files, meant that 22 000 persons were being detained in 2018,
      representing 12 % of the adult Uygur population of Konasheher County1; expresses its
      concerns over the alleged accusations of the systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture of
      women in China’s re-education camps;

4.    Urges the Chinese Government to put an immediate end to the practice of arbitrary
      detention without charge, trial or conviction for criminal offences targeted against
      Uyghurs and other ethnic Turkic peoples, to close all camps and detention centres, and
      to immediately and unconditionally release those detained, and to reunite the Uyghur
      children who are forcibly placed in state-run boarding facilities, with their parents;

5.    Recalls that China has ratified the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
      Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which provides for the absolute and
      non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment
      or punishment;

6.    Calls on the Chinese authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the Uyghur
      scholar and 2019 Sakharov Prize Laureate Ilham Tohti, and to ensure, in the meantime,
      that he has regular and unrestricted access to his family and the lawyers of his choice;

7.    Reiterates its call on the Chinese authorities to allow free, meaningful and unhindered
      access to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and unrestricted access to the
      internment camps for independent journalists, international observers and investigative
      bodies, including, in particular, the mandate holders of the UN Human Rights Council
      Special Procedures and the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, as well as to
      the detention centres, in order to assess the Chinese allegations that these are no longer
      operational;

8.    Recalls the proposals to hold a UN Human Rights Council special session or urgent
      debate on the deteriorating human rights situation in China and on the adoption of a
      resolution to create a monitoring and reporting mechanism, in line with a global call by
      hundreds of civil society organisations from all regions;

9.    Deplores the fact that, in the framework of her visit to China and the Xinjiang Uyghur
      Autonomous Region, the Chinese authorities did not allow the UN High Commissioner
      for Human Rights to have full access to independent civil society organisations, human
      rights defenders and to the detention centres, which prevented her from witnessing the
      full scale of the political re-education camps in Xinjiang; regrets the fact that UN
      Human Rights Commissioner Bachelet failed to clearly hold the Chinese Government
      accountable for human rights abuses against the Uyghurs during her visit;

10.   Urges the High Commissioner to immediately publish the long-awaited report on
      human rights abuses in Xinjiang, based on the available, broad and ever-increasing

1     https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/24/xinjiang-michelle-bachelet-china-
      uyghur/

      body of evidence of the scale and gravity of the human rights violations being
      committed by the Chinese authorities;

11.   Urges the Member States and the Vice-President of the Commission / High
      Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to swiftly adopt
      additional sanctions targeting high-ranking Chinese officials, such as Chen Quanguo,
      Zhao Kezhi, Guo Shengkun and Hu Lianhe, as well as others identified in the Xinjiang
      police files, and other individuals and entities, who are involved in the systematic
      human rights violations in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;

12.   Calls on the Council to address the human rights violations in Xinjiang at the next
      European Council and to urge the G7 and G20 member states likewise to address the
      topic;

13.   Calls for the EU and its Member States to take all necessary steps, in accordance with
      the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, to put
      an end to these atrocities and ensure responsibility for the crimes committed, including
      through international accountability mechanisms;

14.   Acknowledges that EU-China relations are increasingly characterised by economic
      competition and systemic rivalry; acknowledges the fact that EU leaders raised the
      grave violations in Xinjiang at the recent EU-China summit and stresses the importance
      of continuing to raise the issue on every occasion and at the highest levels;

15.   Encourages the EU and the Member States to urgently identify and mitigate the risks
      related to Chinese foreign interference; strongly condemns all forms of transnational
      repression or attempts to repress Chinese dissidents or Uyghur community
      representatives residing abroad;

16.   Calls for the EU and the Member States to suspend their extradition treaties with China
      and Hong Kong;

17.   Calls on the Chinese authorities to allow all Uyghurs wishing to leave the People’s
      Republic of China to do so;

18.   Calls on the Commission to propose an import ban on all products produced by forced
      labour and on products produced by all Chinese companies listed as exploiting forced
      labour; reiterates its position in favour of an ambitious corporate sustainability due
      diligence directive;

19.   Reiterates its call for the EU and the Member States to check whether entities operating
      in the EU internal market are directly or indirectly involved in creating mass
      surveillance systems in Xinjiang, in running or building detention facilities for minority
      groups in Xinjiang or in conducting transactions with any person sanctioned for the
      abuse of Uyghurs and other minority groups in Xinjiang; stresses that the determination
      of these facts should trigger trade-related measures, exclusion from public procurement
      and sanctions;

20.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign
      Affairs and Security Policy, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the

UN Secretary-General, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and to the
Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of China.

  Human Rights on organ harvesting in China,

– having regard to the final judgment of the Independent Tribunal into Forced Organ
  Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience in China (China Tribunal), issued on 1 March
  2020,

– having regard to Rules 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law are
   at the centre of the EU’s relations with China, in line with the EU’s commitment to uphold
   these values in its external action and China’s commitment to adhere to them in its own
   development and international cooperation;

B. whereas since President Xi Jinping assumed power in March 2013, the human rights
   situation in China has continued to deteriorate; whereas the Chinese Government has
   become increasingly hostile towards human rights and the rule of law;

C. whereas 10 000 illicit human organ transplants are performed each year worldwide;
   whereas the trade in human organ trafficking generates, according to the World Health
   Organization (WHO), more than EUR 1 billion in profits per year;

D. whereas the People’s Republic of China has extremely low rates of voluntary organ
   donation owing to traditional beliefs; whereas in 1984, China implemented regulations
   that permitted the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners; whereas China declared
   that it had stopped using organs from executed prisoners in 2015 and had launched a
   national donation system, without, however, ever completely banning the practice, which
   still remains legal;

E. whereas the organ transplant system in China does not comply with the WHO’s
   requirements for transparency and traceability in organ procurement pathways, and
   whereas the Chinese Government has resisted independent scrutiny of the system;
   whereas voluntary and informed consent is a precondition for ethical organ donation;

F. whereas forced organ harvesting must be understood as the killing of a person without
   their consent so that their organs may be removed and transplanted into another person;
   whereas this practice must be considered an egregious and intolerable violation of the
   fundamental right to life;

G. whereas the UN Committee Against Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on torture
   and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have expressed concern
   over the allegations of organ harvesting from prisoners, and have called on the
   Government of the People’s Republic of China to increase the accountability and
   transparency of the organ transplant system and punish those responsible for abuses;

H. whereas the China Tribunal1 issued its final judgment in March 2020, concluding that
   forced organ harvesting had been committed for years throughout China on a significant

1   https://chinatribunal.com/

   scale and that Falun Gong practitioners had been one – and probably the main – source of
   organ supply; whereas the Chinese Government refused to testify before the Tribunal;

I. whereas the heavy reliance on executed and living prisoners as a source of transplant
   organs entails a wide range of unacceptable human rights and medical ethics violations;

J. whereas according to UN human rights experts in their statement of 10 June 2021, there is
   credible information that detainees from ethnic, linguistic or religious minorities in China
   have undergone medical examinations, including blood tests and organ examinations such
   as ultrasound and x-rays, essential to check matches for organs for transplant, without
   their free, voluntary and informed consent;

K. whereas UN human rights experts have previously raised the issue with the Chinese
   Government in 2006 and 2007; whereas the Chinese Government’s responses lacked data
   such as information on the sources of organs used for transplant surgeries or information-
   sharing systems which could have helped with the identification and protection of victims
   of trafficking, and the effective investigation and prosecution of traffickers;

L. whereas the Chinese Government has denied accusations of organ harvesting, notably
   through its response to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and
   has repeatedly and categorically denied that Falun Gong practitioners have been killed for
   their organs;

1. Expresses its serious concerns about the reports of persistent, systematic, inhumane and
   state-sanctioned organ harvesting from prisoners in the People’s Republic of China, and,
   more specifically, from Falun Gong practitioners and other minorities such as Uyghurs,
   Tibetans and Christians;

2. Recalls that China has ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman
   or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which provides for the absolute and non-
   derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or
   punishment;

3. Considers that the practice of organ harvesting from living prisoners on death row and
   prisoners of conscience in the People’s Republic of China may amount to crimes against
   humanity, as defined in Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court;
   urges the People’s Republic of China to sign and accede to the Rome Statute;

4. Calls on the Chinese authorities to promptly respond to the allegations of organ harvesting
   and to allow independent monitoring by international human rights mechanisms, including
   the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights;

5. Expresses its concerns over the lack of independent oversight as to whether prisoners or
   detainees provide valid consent to organ donation; denounces the lack of information from
   the Chinese authorities on reports that the families of deceased detainees and prisoners are
   being prevented from claiming their bodies;

6. Urges the Chinese authorities to request and ensure the free and informed consent of
   prisoners or detainees in connection with medical examinations and to adopt a regulatory
   framework, in line with international conventions, for a voluntary and transparent organ
   donation system;

7. Calls for the EU and its Member States to raise the issue of organ harvesting in China at
   every Human Rights Dialogue; insists that the EU and its Member States publicly
   condemn organ transplant abuses in China; calls on the Member States to take the
   necessary actions in order to prevent transplant tourism to China by their citizens and to
   raise awareness of this issue among their citizens travelling to China;

8. Welcomes the visit of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to
   China; urges the UN to continue its investigation into organ trafficking during this visit;

9. Calls for the EU and its Member States to raise the issue of forced organ harvesting in its
   engagement with third countries, especially with its partners in the Gulf region, where
   Chinese transplant centres have advertised ‘halal organs’ from Uyghurs and Muslim
   minorities in China;

10. Calls on China to fully comply with the WHO’s requirements for transparency and
    traceability in organ procurement pathways;

11. Calls on the Member States to ensure that their conventions and cooperation agreements
    with non-EU countries, including China, in the area of health and research respect the
    EU’s ethical principles in relation to organ donation and the use for scientific purposes of
    elements and products of the human body; calls on the relevant institutions in the Member
    States to evaluate and revisit the terms of their collaborations with Chinese institutions on
    transplant medicine, research and training;

12. Requires that the Chinese authorities grant open, unfettered and meaningful access to the
    UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the mandate holders of the special
    procedures of the UN Human Rights Council to visit Xinjiang; asks the Chinese
    Government to cooperate with the UN organisations on this matter; urges the UN Human
    Rights Council to deal with the issue of forced organ harvesting as a matter of priority;

13. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Vice-
    President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and
    Security Policy, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Government
    and Parliament of the People’s Republic of China and the UN High Commissioner for
    Human Rights.

– having regard to the 11th EU-China Strategic Dialogue of 28 September 2021 between

– having regard to the remarks by European Council President Charles Michel after the EU-

– having regard to the joint statement of President Michel and President von der Leyen on
  defending EU interests and values in a complex and vital partnership following the 22nd
  EU-China summit that took place on 22 June 2020,

– having regard to the Basic Law of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong
  Kong, which was adopted on 4 April 1990 and entered into force on 1 July 1997,

– having regard to the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great
  Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People’s Republic of China
  (PRC) of 19 December 1984 on the Question of Hong Kong, also known as the Sino-
  British Joint Declaration, which was registered by the Chinese and British Governments at
  the United Nations on 12 June 1985,

– having regard to the Council conclusions of 28 July 2020 on Hong Kong,

– having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of
  16 December 1966, and the concerns raised by the UN Human Rights Committee in its
  List of Issues, of 26 August 2020 in relation to the fourth periodic report of Hong Kong,
  China,

– having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948,

– having regard to Rules 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
   should remain at the centre of the long-standing relationship between the EU and China in
   line with the EU’s commitment to uphold these values in its external actions and China’s
   expressed interest in adhering to them in its own development and international
   cooperation;

B. whereas Hong Kong is bound by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
   and has a legal obligation to respect the rights to freedom of information, expression and
   association, as well as to guarantee due process; whereas Hong Kong will soon be
   reviewed on the fulfilment of its obligations under the covenant;

C. whereas between 1 July 2020 and the end of 2021, police in Hong Kong arrested or
   ordered the arrest of at least 139 people in relation to the National Security Law (NSL);
   whereas at of the end of 2021, 94 people were formally charged, 60 of whom were in pre-
   trial detention; whereas peaceful political expression has been disproportionately
   restricted and even criminalised under the NSL; whereas prominent activists, such as
   Chow Hang-tung, have been charged for encouraging citizens to light candles to
   commemorate the victims of Tiananmen Square and whereas the Hong Kong Alliance in

   Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China disbanded after the authorities used
   the annual Tiananmen candlelight vigil the group had been organising for 30 years as
   evidence of it ‘endangering national security’; whereas the NSL flagrantly violates the
   ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle and the Sino-British Joint Declaration;

D. whereas the political opposition in Hong Kong was effectively obliterated following the
   arrests of 55 people under the NSL on 6 and 7 January 2021, most of whom were pro-
   democracy lawmakers and activists;

E. whereas on 17 June 2021, 500 police officers raided the premises of Apple Daily, taking
   away computers and documents, including some containing journalistic material, and
   arresting five newspaper executives; whereas all were charged with ‘colluding with a
   foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security’ under the NSL;
   whereas on 23 June 2021, Apple Daily announced it was closing down after 26 years;
   whereas charging the pro-democracy activist and former owner of Apple Daily, Jimmy
   Lai, and six former Apple Daily journalists with ‘conspiracy to distribute seditious
   material’ is a further assault on press freedom in Hong Kong;

F. whereas on 29 December 2021, 200 police officers raided the office of Stand News,
   taking away its computers and documents, and arresting seven people, all of whom were
   senior or former senior staff members of the company, for conspiracy to publish seditious
   publications; whereas Stand News was shut down immediately; whereas Hong Kong’s
   online media outlet DB Channel has stopped operating in the city, as its detained co-
   founder Frankie Fung awaits trial under the NSL; whereas Citizen News, another pro-
   democracy online media outlet, recently announced its closure, citing a ‘deteriorating
   media environment’;

G. whereas Amnesty International closed its two offices in Hong Kong in late 2021, driven
   by the NSL, which made it impossible for human rights organisations to work freely and
   without fear of serious reprisals from the government; whereas over 60 civil society
   organisations closed due to repression between 1 January 2021 and 4 January 2022,
   including 12 trade unions, eight media organisations, eight neighbourhood groups, seven
   professional groups, five student organisations and four religious groups;

H. whereas dozens of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have been jailed for fomenting
   secession and subversion of the state under the NSL, such as Ma Chun-man, Tony Chung
   Hon-lam and Chow Hang-tung;

I. whereas the European Union continues to have deep concerns regarding the PRC’s NSL
   for Hong Kong; whereas this is a sensitive issue, with far-reaching consequences for Hong
   Kong and its people, for EU and foreign citizens, for EU and international civil society
   organisations, and for business confidence in Hong Kong; whereas the entry into force of
   the NSL has increased the risks for EU citizens in Hong Kong;

J. whereas the European Union has a strong stake in the continued stability and prosperity of
   Hong Kong under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle and attaches great
   importance to the preservation of Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, in line with the
   Basic Law and international commitments; whereas in the current environment, those
   principles are on the verge of being irreversibly undermined;

K. whereas ‘patriots-only’ Legislative Council elections took place on 19 December 2021
   under new rules imposed by Beijing, which effectively barred pro-democracy parties from
   running, criminalised calls for voters to boycott or cast blank ballots, saw the Hong Kong
   SAR threaten international media outlets covering the election, extended voting to
   Hongkongers resident in mainland China, and saw only 30 % of registered voters cast
   their ballots; whereas the recent changes in the electoral system run counter to the
   commitments to greater democratic representation enshrined in the Basic Law; whereas
   Hong Kong is left without any pro-democratic opposition since its representatives are
   either barred from taking part in elections or have been jailed;

L. whereas in July 2021, 21 pro-democracy candidates were disqualified from running in
   Macao’s legislative elections; whereas on 12 September 2021, the elections for the
   seventh Legislative Assembly of Macao were held without a real political opposition,
   which could lead to long-term social instability, and resulted in a record-low voter turnout
   of 42,38 %; whereas journalists at Macao’s public broadcaster have been ordered to
   promote ‘patriotism, respect and love’ for China and at least six journalists have resigned
   since the introduction of new editorial rules, showing that concerns over the NSL also
   affect other regions; whereas the Macao Basic Law also protects the freedom of the press
   and will be in place until 2049;

M. whereas the pressure on Hong Kong’s civil society has intensified, as reflected by the
   disbanding of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, the Hong Kong Alliance in
   Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, the China Human Rights Lawyers
   Concern Group, the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union and the Civil Human
   Rights Front, as well as the closure of the Amnesty International office;

N. whereas the Hong Kong Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, has indicated that the SAR will
   introduce Article 23 of the NSL, which will criminalise foreign political organisations and
   deter them from conducting activities in Hong Kong;

O. whereas the independence of the judiciary must be guaranteed, given its crucial role in
   safeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong;

P. whereas in its resolution of 8 July 2021, Parliament called ‘on the Commission, the
   Council and the Member States to decline invitations for government representatives and
   diplomats to attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics unless the Chinese Government
   demonstrates a verifiable improvement in the human rights situation in Hong Kong’;

Q. whereas China has been engaging in aggressive rhetoric and has introduced an
   unexplained and undeclared de facto ban preventing Lithuanian-made products from
   entering the Chinese market; whereas such unlegislated actions and practices violate not
   only all international and World Trade Organization rules of trade, but also directly
   impact the underlying principles of the EU single market;

1. Condemns in the strongest terms the fact that freedom of expression, freedom of
   association and freedom of the press are as severely restricted in Hong Kong as they are in
   China, and reiterates its solidarity with the people of Hong Kong in their fight for freedom
   and democracy; deplores the political persecution to which many journalists who are now
   in exile or in prison have been subjected; calls on China to ensure that all journalists can
   conduct their work freely and without impediments or fear of reprisals; stresses that the
   freedom of the press and media should be ensured;

2. Calls on the Hong Kong Government to release all political prisoners in Hong Kong; calls
   for the immediate and unconditional release and the dropping of all charges against all
   peaceful Hong Kong protesters arrested in the last few years, who simply exercised their
   right to freedom of expression or other human rights, such as Joshua Wong, Koo Sze-yiu,
   Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Margaret Ng and Kok Tsz-lun, a dual Chinese and Portuguese
   national and, therefore, an EU citizen, who was sentenced in Shenzhen in 2020 to seven
   months’ imprisonment for allegedly trying to flee Hong Kong by boat and is currently
   awaiting trial in custody in Hong Kong; condemns the ongoing cases, including those of
   human rights defenders Chow Hang-tung, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho; calls for the
   immediate and unconditional release of Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai, who is
   imprisoned in the PRC;

3. Stresses that the NSL prevents a relationship of trust between China and the EU, which is
   undermining future cooperation and leading to a further erosion of Beijing’s credibility on
   the international stage, while also significantly damaging Hong Kong and Macao’s
   international status and reputations; urges the Chinese authorities to repeal the NSL,
   which is a breach of the PRC’s commitments and obligations under international law,
   namely the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration
   respectively, and urges the Hong Kong and Macao authorities to fully respect the rule of
   law, human rights, democratic principles and the high degree of autonomy under the ‘One
   country, two Systems’ principle, as enshrined in the Hong Kong and Macao Basic Laws
   and in line with their domestic and international obligations; notes with concern the
   increasing attempts by the Chinese Government to legitimise its authoritarian system
   internally and externally by co-opting, redefining and distorting a number of political
   ideas, including the principles of democracy, through such notions as ‘democracy with
   Hong Kong characteristics’ or ‘whole-process people’s democracy’ and regards such
   attempts as a political farce;

4. Deeply regrets the recent modifications to the electoral law of Hong Kong and the arrests
   and harassment of representatives of the pro-democratic opposition, which de jure and de
   facto prevent free and fair elections at all levels and have led to the dismantlement of all
   forms of political opposition; stresses that this runs counter to the commitments to greater
   democratic representation enshrined in the Hong Kong Basic Law;

5. Deplores the decision by the Hong Kong authorities to ban, for the past two years, the
   annual 4 June Tiananmen Square vigil and the annual 1 July march, as well as Macao’s
   Court of Final Appeal decision to ban the city’s annual Tiananmen Square vigil; deeply
   regrets the removal of a monument to the victims of Tiananmen Square, the Pillar of
   Shame, by the University of Hong Kong from its premises and sees this as part of a
   continuous attack on academic freedom in Hong Kong and an attempt to erase history and
   collective memory;

6. Calls on the Hong Kong Chief Executive to withdraw plans to introduce Article 23 of the
   NSL and to recommit to upholding the Basic Law, which guarantees freedom of
   association, freedom of assembly, freedom of expression and freedom of religion and
   belief;

7. Underlines that the independence of the judiciary must be safeguarded and the
   politicisation of the courts avoided as a key priority; reiterates its call for the EEAS to
   prepare a detailed public report on the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in
   addition to the Hong Kong annual report; calls on the EEAS to include discussions on the

    deteriorating rule of law situation in Hong Kong and the security of EU citizens in the
    annual structured dialogue meetings between the Hong Kong SAR Government and the
    EU;

8. Expresses concern over the appointment of the chief of staff of the armed police force in
   Xinjiang, Peng Jingtang, as the People’s Liberation Army’s Hong Kong garrison
   commander and about comments that he will focus on alleged terrorist activities in Hong
   Kong;

9. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to address the enforcement of the NSL as
   a top priority on the agenda of all EU-China meetings, including in diplomatic
   consultations in preparation for those meetings; recalls the importance of the EU
   continuing to raise the issue of human rights violations in China, in particular the case of
   minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet, at every political and human rights dialogue with
   Chinese authorities and in line with the EU’s commitment to project a strong, clear and
   unified voice in its approach to China; recalls that China has signed up to a wide range of
   international human rights treaties and conventions, and therefore highlights the
   importance of pursuing dialogue with China to ensure that it lives up to its commitment to
   abide by the international human rights framework;

10. Is extremely concerned at attempts by Chinese authorities to target Hong Kong diaspora
    communities, including human rights defenders, in EU Member States; reiterates its call
    on the EU Member States to suspend active extradition treaties with the PRC and Hong
    Kong;

11. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to review the Agreement between the
    European Community and Hong Kong, China on cooperation and mutual administrative
    assistance in customs matters1 and the EU’s support for Hong Kong’s seat at the World
    Trade Organization, in the light of the destruction of the autonomy the territory had under
    the previously established ‘One Country, Two Systems Model’;

12. Reiterates its serious concerns about the various human rights abuses in China and recalls
    that full respect for universal values is essential;

13. Calls on the Council to introduce targeted sanctions under the EU Global Human Rights
    Sanctions Regime (the EU’s Magnitsky-style sanctions) against the Hong Kong and PRC
    officials responsible for the ongoing human rights crackdown, including Carrie Lam,
    Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, Xia Baolong, Zhang Xiaoming, Luo Huining, Zheng Yanxiong,
    Chris Tang Ping-keung and John Lee Ka-chiu; calls on Council and the Commission to
    agree to draw up a list of companies which should be subject to sanctions and investment
    bans for their complicity in the ongoing human rights crackdown in Hong Kong;

14. Reiterates its previous position that any ratification of the EU-China comprehensive
    agreement on investment must take into account the ongoing human rights situation in
    Hong Kong and China’s commitment to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and involve a
    clear and binding commitment to workers’ rights so as to ratify and implement
    International Labour Organization Conventions No. 29 on forced labour, No. 105 on the




1   OJ L 151, 18.6.1999, p. 21.

   abolition of forced labour, No. 87 on freedom of association and protection of the right to
   organise and No. 98 on the right to organise and collective bargaining;

15. Expresses concern that the closure of Stand News and Citizen News will lead to increased
    pressure from the Chinese authorities on the remaining local news publications;

16. Fully supports proposals to hold a United Nations Human Rights Council special session
    or urgent debate on the deteriorating human rights situation in China, including with
    regard to the implementation of the NSL in Hong Kong and Macao and the adoption of a
    resolution to create a monitoring and reporting mechanism in line with a global call by
    hundreds of civil society organisations from all regions and a call for action by an
    unprecedented number of UN special procedures;

17. Calls on the VP/HR to cooperate closely with like-minded countries and partners to halt
    the erosion of Hong Kong’s freedoms; welcomes the newly established bilateral EU-US
    dialogue on China and insists that stronger coordination on human rights, including with a
    focus on the situation in Hong Kong, should be a key objective;

18. Reiterates its call for EU Member States to implement the EU Council conclusions of
    28 July 2020 and introduce lifeboat schemes for Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and
    journalists who remain at risk of imprisonment under the ongoing crackdown on human
    rights; reiterates the need to set a clear timeline for the implementation of the package of
    measures of July 2020 and calls on the EEAS to continue keeping its implementation on
    the agenda and to prepare concrete responses to the possible extraterritorial effects of the
    NSL;

19. Condemns China’s coercion and intimidation of Lithuania; welcomes the recent
    statements of solidarity with Lithuania aimed at resisting China’s coercive actions; urges
    the EU to defend the basic principles of the single market against Chinese intimidation;

20. Calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to decline invitations for
    government representatives and diplomats to attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics
    since the Chinese Government has not demonstrated a verifiable improvement in the
    human rights situations in Hong Kong, Macao, the Xinjiang Uyghur Region, Tibet and
    elsewhere in China;

21. Calls on the EEAS to investigate the status of the prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy
    activists who are not currently in jail, but are unable to leave the territory as a result of the
    authorities continuing to confiscate their travel documents and subjecting them to travel
    bans; calls on the EEAS and the Member States to fully apply the EU Guidelines on
    Human Rights Defenders, including by requesting prison visits, observing trials, releasing
    public statements and raising cases with the authorities at all levels; calls on the EEAS to
    ensure adequate resources for the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao to
    enable it to continue conducting and adequately step up trial observation and human rights
    monitoring;

22. Highlights, in particular, the importance of stepping up support to academia by expanding
    scholarships and other kinds of support instruments for Hong Kong academics and
    students so they can be enrolled in exchange programmes and cooperate with EU
    universities; calls on the EEAS and the Commission to develop and coordinate measures

   to protect the academic freedom of Hong Kong students and scientists at EU universities
   against pressure from Chinese authorities;

23. Calls on the Commission and the EEAS to step up the application of and work on
    appropriate export control mechanisms to deny China and Hong Kong access to
    technologies used to violate human rights; encourages the Commission to finalise the
    preparation of effective EU corporate due diligence legislation imposing due diligence
    obligations on EU companies and companies operating in the EU single market;

24. Calls for the EU and the Member States to help to save Hong Kong’s democratic memory
    by assisting with the archiving, publicising and documenting of human rights violations,
    and to counteract actions of the PRC by making books banned in Hong Kong widely
    available online; expresses its support for efforts by international television channels, such
    as Deutsche Welle and France 24, to regularly report on developments in Hong Kong;

25. Calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to cooperate with
    international partners to help secure democracy in Taiwan, particularly in the light of
    recent developments in relations between Lithuania and Taiwan orchestrated by the
    Chinese Government and the erosion of Hong Kong’s freedoms under China’s policy of
    abandoning the ‘One country, Two systems’ approach;

26. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Vice-
    President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and

– having regard to the UN experts’ call of 26 June 2020 for decisive measures to protect

– having regard to the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom and the
  Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong of
  19 December 1984, also known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration,

– having regard to the joint communication from the Commission and the High
  Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to the European
  Parliament and the Council of 12 March 2019 entitled ‘EU-China – A strategic outlook’
  (JOIN(2019)0005),

– having regard to the EU’s ‘One China’ policy and to the ‘one country, two systems’
  principle,

– having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948,

– having regard to Rule 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
   should remain at the centre of the long-standing relationship between the EU and China,
   in line with the EU’s commitment to upholding these values in its external action and
   China’s expressed interest in adhering to them in its own development and international
   cooperation;

B. whereas on 17 June 2021, 500 Hong Kong armed police raided the offices of the largest
   pro-opposition newspaper, Apple Daily, forcing journalists to leave the newsroom, and
   sifted through reporters’ computers, phones and journalistic material, in the first case in
   which authorities have cited media articles as potentially violating the Hong Kong
   National Security Law (NSL); whereas five of the paper’s senior executives and editors
   were arrested, including Editor-in-Chief Ryan Law, Chief Executive Cheung Kim-hung,
   Chief Operating Officer Royston Chow, Associate Publisher Chan Puiman and Director of
   Apple Daily Digital Cheung Chi-wai;

C. whereas, according to a Hong Kong police spokesperson, the newspaper executives and
   editors were arrested for their role in the publication of more than 30 articles calling on
   foreign countries to impose sanctions in relation to the NSL; whereas such calls were
   considered by the Hong Kong authorities as collusion with foreign countries endangering
   national security;

D. whereas on 23 June 2021, police also arrested Apple Daily’s China Beat editorial writer
   Yeung Ching-kee (also known as Li Ping) and also charged him with ‘conspiracy to
   collude with foreign forces’, and former senior editorial writer at Apple Daily Fung Wai-
   kwong (also known as Lo Fung) was arrested on 27 June 2021 for the same offence;

E. whereas, following the freeze of all its assets (around EUR 2 million) by the Hong Kong
   authorities on the basis of the NSL, Apple Daily was forced to definitively close on 24
   June 2021 after 26 years; whereas more than 800 Apple Daily staff have lost their job and
   are unlikely to be re-employed in Hong Kong;

F. whereas the founder of Apple Daily, Jimmy Lai, is serving 20 months in jail for his
   involvement in the 2019 protest movement and faces additional charges under the NSL
   that carry a possible life sentence; whereas Apple Daily had always been an open and
   critical voice vis-à-vis the mainland and Hong Kong’s leadership and was the only
   Chinese-language newspaper in Hong Kong that was free from the Chinese Government’s
   control;

G. whereas the NSL allowed one single official, namely the Hong Kong Secretary for
   Security, to freeze all the assets of Apple Daily, without a formal charge or a fair trial,
   simply based on claims of violations of the NSL; whereas such a procedure could be
   applied to any publicly traded entity or to any company simply doing business in Hong
   Kong;

H. whereas 30 June 2021 marked the first anniversary of the entry into force of the NSL;
   whereas the authorities had announced that the law would only target an ‘extreme
   minority’ threatening public security; whereas, however, over the course of one year, the
   law was applied to completely dismantle Hong Kong’s free society on almost all fronts,
   based on an array of such vaguely defined charges as ‘subversion’, ‘secession’ and

   ‘collusion with foreign forces’, completely transforming Hong Kong’s political and legal
   landscape and stifling freedom of the press and free expression of opinions; whereas
   national security was used to justify censorship, harassment, arrests and prosecutions
   systematically targeting political and elected representatives, activists, students and
   journalists in the pro-democracy camp; whereas it is estimated that 128 people have been
   arrested under the NSL and 64 people formally charged, of whom 47 are currently in pre-
   trial detention; whereas the NSL completely violates the ‘one country, two systems’
   principle; whereas the erosion of press freedoms is also counter to Hong Kong’s aspiration
   as an international business hub;

I. whereas, since its entry into force, the NSL has been used to intimidate, attack and even
   harass journalists and the media, who had already started to quit their jobs as a result;
   whereas at least 10 journalists and defenders of press freedoms are now facing potential
   life sentences; whereas the forced closure of Apple Daily, based on charges that its
   activities constitute a threat to national security, amounts to the definitive end of media
   freedom and freedom of expression in Hong Kong;

J. whereas on 27 June 2021 another independent media outlet, Stand News, announced the
   deletion of all opinion articles from its website and six directors resigned; whereas the
   Hong Kong Journalists Association has warned against further arrests of journalists and
   reported that the authorities have drawn up a list of individuals to be arrested under the
   NSL;

K. whereas at least two foreign judges have resigned from their position citing the NSL as the
   main reason; whereas in June this year pro-Beijing law-makers successfully intervened,
   for the first time, in the appointment of a senior judge to the Hong Kong Court of Final
   Appeal, in what appears to be a first concrete step in attempting to undermine the
   independence of the judiciary;

L. whereas the Hong Kong authorities have introduced a National Security Law
   whistleblower hotline; whereas education material and curricula in primary and secondary
   schools, including international schools attended by expatriate children, are now being
   vetted based on NSL principles;

M. whereas 10 prominent pro-democracy figures, namely Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Jimmy Lai,
   Margaret Ng, Cyd Ho, Lee Cheuk-yan, Leung Kwok-hung, Au Nok-hin, Leung Yiu-
   chung and Yeung Sum, were sentenced on 16 April 2021 in Hong Kong, in two separate
   cases, for their peaceful involvement in protests; whereas their sentences range from
   prison sentences ranging between 8 and 18 months, and suspended prison sentences from
   8 to 12 months in five of the cases; whereas these latest decisions follow the sentencing of
   Joshua Wong and Sze-yiu Koo on 13 April 2021; whereas the lengthy imprisonment of
   some of the individuals for non-violent acts when exercising protected civic rights is a
   further sign of the continued shrinking of democratic space and erosion of fundamental
   freedoms in Hong Kong;

N. whereas the NSL is de jure and de facto in clear violation of the 1984 Sino-British Joint
   Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law of the HKSAR, which guarantees the autonomy and
   the independence of the executive, legislature and judiciary, as well as basic rights and
   freedoms such as freedom of speech, assembly, association and of the press for 50 years
   after the handover of sovereignty; whereas the NSL also prevents Hong Kong from
   abiding by its international human rights obligations, including the ICCPR; whereas both

   the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law enshrine the ‘one country, two systems’
   principle’ as agreed between China and the United Kingdom;

O. whereas the EU and the European Parliament have always strongly supported the ‘one
   country, two systems’ principle and the preservation of Hong Kong’s high degree of
   autonomy in line with the Basic Law and international commitments, and whereas the EU
   has a strong stake in the continued stability and prosperity of Hong Kong under this
   principle; whereas in the current circumstances these principles are being inevitably and
   irreversibly undermined and nullified;

P. whereas the EU continues to have deep concerns regarding the People’s Republic of
   China’s (PRC) NSL for Hong Kong; whereas this is a sensitive issue, with far-reaching
   consequences for Hong Kong and its people, for EU and foreign citizens, for EU and
   international civil society organisations, as well as for business confidence in Hong Kong;
   whereas the entry into force of the NSL would increase the risks for EU citizens;

Q. whereas according to the Human Rights Watch annual report, China is in the midst of its
   darkest period for human rights since the Tiananmen Square massacre;

R. whereas the journalists at Macao’s public broadcaster have been ordered to promote
   ‘patriotism, respect and love’ for China, and at least six journalists have resigned after the
   introduction of new editorial rules, showing that concerns over the NSL also affects other
   regions; whereas the Macao Basic Law also protects freedom of press and is in place until
   2049;

S. whereas a joint statement delivered by Canada on behalf of 44 states – the highest number
   of signatories so far – including 23 EU Member States, was adopted at the ongoing
   session of the UN Human Rights Council;

1. Condemns in the strongest terms the forced closure of the Apple Daily newspaper, the
   continued freezing of its assets and the arrests of its journalists as yet another step by the
   PRC in dismantling free society in Hong Kong and setting the definitive end of media
   freedom and freedom of expression there;

2. Is alarmed by the rapid deterioration of the human rights situation in Hong Kong and more
   specifically the open attacks against freedom of speech and freedom of the press, as the
   PRC continues to undertake an unprecedented crackdown on fundamental freedoms,
   which has unfolded into a human rights emergency, and stresses the need for the EU to
   take urgent and resolute action;

3. Expresses its strongest solidarity with all Hong Kong journalists who, despite the entry
   into force of the NSL, have continued to strenuously defend media freedom and
   independent journalism and to keep reporting on the dramatic evolution of events in Hong
   Kong; calls on the Hong Kong authorities to end all legal harassment and all intimidation
   directed at journalists and to strive for the protection and the safety of journalists against
   all forms of violence, pressure, discrimination, unfair legal proceedings and all attempts
   aimed at preventing them from accomplishing their mission or of weakening their ability
   to do so in accordance with international norms, especially with Articles 19 and 21 of the
   ICCPR on the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of peaceful
   assembly;

4. Urges the Hong Kong authorities to immediately and unconditionally release and drop all
   charges against all journalists, as well as all peaceful protesters, activists and political
   representatives, who have simply exercised their right to freedom of expression and other
   human rights and who have been arrested on charges pursuant to the NSL; calls for a stop
   to politically motivated prosecutions and other legal procedures against peaceful
   protesters with a view to silencing critical voices and deterring people from participating
   in the public sphere;

5. Reiterates its grave concern about the entry into force of the NSL on 30 June 2020, which
   is in breach of the PRC’s commitments and obligations under international law, namely
   the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and is a comprehensive assault on the city’s high
   degree of autonomy, rule of law and fundamental freedoms; recognises that the law has
   been used numerous times as grounds for disqualifying and imprisoning electoral
   candidates and politicians, arresting students over social media posts and banning
   common protest slogans; stresses that the NSL prevents a relationship of trust between
   China and the EU, undermines future cooperation and leads to a further erosion of
   Beijing’s credibility on the international stage;

6. Condemns any attempts at muzzling pro-democracy activists, including the blocking of
   pro-democracy websites, on grounds of the NSL; reiterates that the freedom of expression
   and of information is a fundamental right enshrined in Hong Kong’s domestic and
   international law;

7. Expresses grave concern over the reported practices of secret detention, torture and ill-
   treatment, and forced confessions by the Hong Kong Police Force and in Hong Kong jails,
   including concerns over individuals currently awaiting trial who are being held in solitary
   confinement for long periods of time;

8. Condemns the emerging restrictions on the independence of the judiciary and the
   increasing politicisation of courts; stresses the urgent need to prevent, as the next step, the
   dismantling of Hong Kong’s independent judiciary and calls on the EEAS to prepare a
   detailed public report on the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in addition
   to the Hong Kong annual report;

9. Expresses concern at the recently adopted changes to Hong Kong’s electoral law, which
   introduce a ‘patriot-only’ principle and set up a vetting committee to screen all election
   candidates, which will weed out any last remaining dissenting voices and totally runs
   counter to the commitments to greater democratic representation enshrined in the Hong
   Kong Basic Law;

10. Urges the Chinese authorities to repeal the NSL, which damages Hong Kong’s
    international status, and urges the Hong Kong authorities to fully restore respect for the
    rule of law, human rights, democratic principles and the high degree of autonomy under
    the ‘one country, two systems’ principle, as enshrined in the Hong Kong Basic Law and in
    line with its domestic and international obligations;

11. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to address the NSL as a top priority on
    the agenda of all EU-China meetings, including in diplomatic consultations in preparation
    for those meetings; recalls the importance of the EU continuing to raise the issue of
    human rights violations in China, in particular the case of minorities in Xinjiang and
    Tibet, at every political and human rights dialogue with Chinese authorities and in line

   with the EU’s commitment to project a strong, clear and unified voice in its approach to
   China; recalls that China has signed up to a wide range of international human rights
   treaties and conventions and therefore highlights the importance of pursuing dialogue with
   China to ensure that China lives up to its commitment to abide by the international human
   rights framework;

12. Deeply regrets the failure to adopt Council conclusions on Hong Kong at the April EU
    Foreign Affairs Council; strongly supports the VP/HR in submitting draft conclusions at
    the earliest opportunity, and urges the Member States to address the impasse and adopt
    new measures including targeted sanctions under the EU global human rights sanctions
    regime, including the implementation of travel bans and asset freezes, against individuals
    and entities in Hong Kong and China for the serious violations of human rights and
    international law in Hong Kong, including Carrie Lam, Teresa Yeuk-wah Cheng, Xia
    Baolong, Zhang Xiaoming, Luo Huining, Zheng Yanxiong, Chris Tang Ping-keung,
    Stephen Lo Wai-chung, and John Lee Ka-chiu, as well as PRC institutions, which have a
    crucial role in adopting measures and complicit actions undermining Hong Kong’s high
    degree of autonomy and freedoms;

13. Reiterates its position on the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment,
    expressed in its resolution of 21 May 2021, including the urgent need to adopt additional
    targeted measures under the EU global human rights sanctions regime, as necessary, in
    order to continue addressing the repression in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and aimed at
    China putting an end to all the violations;

14. Calls on the EEAS and the Council to continue assessing and making progress on the
    package of measures adopted in July 2020 and to set a clear timeline for their
    implementation; calls on the EEAS to continue its assessment of, and to prepare concrete
    responses to, the possible extraterritorial effects of the NSL, in particular Article 38
    thereof, which provides that the law is applicable also to those who are not permanent
    residents of Hong Kong; welcomes the decision by EU Member States and other
    international partners to suspend extradition treaties with Hong Kong; reiterates its
    demand that the 10 remaining Member States’ extradition treaties with China be
    suspended;

15. Recalls and reiterates its condemnation of the complicity of EU-based banks in freezing
    the assets and bank accounts belonging to former pro-democracy law-makers; calls on the
    EEAS to evaluate the level of compliance, involvement and collaboration of EU-based
    companies with the Hong Kong authorities in enforcing the NSL, and calls on the Member
    States to reach out to EU-based banks to release assets belonging to Hong Kong pro-
    democracy activists;

16. Calls on the Commission to assess the long-term commercial impact for EU firms
    operating in Hong Kong in light of the implementation of Hong Kong’s NSL, with
    reference to the changing rule of law and free flow of information and capital in the city;
    calls on the Commission and the EEAS to continue applying and working on appropriate
    export control mechanisms to deny China and Hong Kong access to technologies used to
    violate human rights, and to consider rules to prevent European investment in companies
    that are complicit in gross human rights violations in China and Hong Kong, including the
    option of an entity list;

17. Strongly welcomes the steps taken by the UK, Australia and Canada to open schemes to
    offer Hong Kong citizens the opportunity to live and work in their respective countries;
    reiterates its urgent call on the Member States to coordinate the implementation of a
    ‘lifeboat scheme’ for pro-democracy activists and political leaders in Hong Kong
    following this escalating deterioration of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to
    issue emergency travel documents for journalists in Hong Kong who are at risk of arrest
    under the NSL;

18. Urges all EU and European diplomatic personnel to do everything they can to provide
    protection and support to peaceful activists and political leaders in Hong Kong, including
    also attending trials, requesting prison visits and consistently and resolutely reaching out
    to local authorities, in full application of the EU Guidelines on human rights defenders
    and other relevant EU policies, including the new EU Action Plan on Human Rights and
    Democracy; expects the EEAS and the Council to devise concrete measures to increase
    support to Hong Kong civil society and media, such as extending the scope of the
    European Endowment for Democracy to projects located in South-East Asia, and
    including active engagement with the Hong Kong diaspora;

19. Calls for the EU and the Member States to ensure that the silenced people of Hong Kong
    are given a voice once more by assisting with the archiving, publicising and documenting
    of human rights violations, and to counteract the PRC by making books that are banned in
    Hong Kong widely available online; expresses its support for efforts by international
    television channels, such as Deutsche Welle and France 24, to regularly report about
    developments in Hong Kong;

20. Calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to decline invitations for
    government representatives and diplomats to attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics
    unless the Chinese Government demonstrates a verifiable improvement in the human
    rights situation in Hong Kong, the Xinjiang Uyghur Region, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and
    elsewhere in China;

21. Urges the Commission and the Member States to increase the number of academic and
    training opportunities within the Erasmus programme for students and young graduates
    from Hong Kong; calls on the EEAS and the Commission to develop and coordinate
    measures to protect the academic freedom of Hong Kong students and scientists at
    European universities from pressure from the Chinese authorities;

22. Reiterates its call for the EU and all its Member States to work in a united and resolute
    fashion towards the holding of a special session or urgent debate on China at the UN
    Human Rights Council and the launching of an independent UN investigation on China;
    highlights the growing international support for the launching of an independent inquiry;

23. Calls for the EU and its Member States to encourage the UN Secretary-General to
    consider all mechanisms at his disposal to ensure independent monitoring and reporting
    on the situation in China, including the appointment of a UN Special Envoy; calls on the
    Council and the VP/HR to work with the international community to establish an
    international contact group on Hong Kong, and to put Hong Kong on the agenda of other
    international organisations on a regular basis;

24. Encourages UN members to hold regular public events to raise awareness about the
    Chinese Government’s grave human rights violations, including crimes against humanity,

   and other violations of international law, including at least one Arria-formula meeting of
   the UN Security Council; would welcome it if the EU institutions and the Member States
   were to consider commemorating 1 July as ‘Stand with Hong Kong Day’ in order to raise
   the European public’s awareness of the situation in Hong Kong each year; reiterates its
   call for the EU and the Member States to consider filing a case before the International
   Court of Justice asserting that China’s decision to impose the NSL on Hong Kong and its
   application violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the ICCPR;

25. Deplores the decision by the Hong Kong police to ban the annual 4 June Tiananmen
    Square vigil and the annual 1 July march while granting special permission for the
    waiving of COVID-19 restrictions to allow Hong Kong officials to celebrate the centenary
    of the Chinese Communist Party;

26. Calls on the VP/HR to cooperate closely with like-minded countries and partners to halt
    the erosion of Hong Kong’s freedoms; welcomes the newly established bilateral EU-US
    dialogue on China, and insists that stronger coordination on human rights, including with
    a focus on the situation in Hong Kong, should be a key objective;

27. Observes that the PRC’s policy of abandoning the ‘one country, two systems’ approach
    has greatly alienated the people of Taiwan, and emphasises its willingness to cooperate
    with international partners in order to help secure democracy in Taiwan;

28. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Vice-
    President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and
    Security Policy, the Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of China, and
    the Chief Executive and the Assembly of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

– having regard to the Protocol of 2014 to the International Labour Organization (ILO)
  Forced Labour Convention of 1930, which has not been signed by China,

– having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948,

– having regard to Rule 132(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
   should remain at the centre of the long-standing relationship between the EU and China,
   in line with the EU’s commitment to upholding these values in its external action and
   China’s expressed interest in adhering to them in its own development and international
   cooperation;

B. whereas on 7 December 2020 the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2020/1998
   establishing the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, which enables the EU to
   impose restrictive measures on targeted individuals, entities and bodies – including states
   and non-state actors – responsible for, involved in or associated with serious human rights
   violations and abuses worldwide; whereas it is important to emphasise that the EU has a
   responsibility to make use of this regulation in the event of massive human rights
   violations;

C. whereas on 22 March 2021 the EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted restrictive measures
   under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime on Zhu Hailun, former Deputy
   Head of the 13th People’s Congress of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region
   (XUAR), Wang Junzheng, Party Secretary of the Xinjiang Production and Construction
   Corps (XPCC) and Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of China’s XUAR, Wang
   Mingshan, Member of the Standing Committee of the Party Committee of the XUAR and
   Secretary of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the XUAR, and Chen Mingguo,
   Director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau (XPSB) and Vice-Chair of the XUAR
   People’s Government, and on the XPCC Public Security Bureau, which runs the detention
   centres in Xinjiang; whereas these four individuals and one entity are responsible for
   serious human rights violations, including the large-scale arbitrary detention and
   degrading treatment of Uyghurs and people from other Muslim ethnic minorities in
   XUAR;

D. whereas, just a few moments after the approval of the EU list, the Spokesperson of the
   Foreign Ministry of the People’s Republic of China announced the adoption of sanctions
   on five MEPs, Reinhard Bütikofer, Michael Gahler, Raphaël Glucksmann, Ilhan
   Kyuchyuk and Miriam Lexmann, Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, 3 MPs
   from EU Member States (Sjoerd Wiemer Sjoerdsma, Samuel Cogolati and Dovile
   Sakaliene), the Political and Security Committee of the Council of the EU, comprising the
   Ambassadors of the 27 EU Member States, two scholars (Adrian Zenz and Björn Jerdén)
   and two think tanks (Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) in Germany and the
   Alliance of Democracies Foundation in Denmark) for ‘severely harming China’s
   sovereignty and interests and maliciously spreading lies and disinformation’;

E. whereas, according to the Spokesperson’s press release, the individuals concerned and
   their families are prohibited from entering mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, and

   whereas they, and any companies or institutions associated with them, are also prohibited
   from doing business with China;

F. whereas, a few days later, China adopted sanctions against MPs, entities and think tanks in
   the UK, Canada and the US, which had also introduced measures against human rights
   abuses in Xinjiang;

G. whereas the Chinese measures constitute an attack against the European Union and its
   Parliament as a whole, the heart of European democracy and values, as well as an attack
   against freedom of research;

H. whereas, while the EU’s sanctions target human rights violations and are based on
   legitimate and proportionate measures embedded in international law, China’s sanctions
   lack any legal justification, are entirely unsubstantiated and arbitrary and target the
   criticism of such human rights violations; whereas the sanctions are clearly an attempt to
   deter the EU from continuing its work and action against human rights abuses in China;

I. whereas China has a track record of human rights violations that eschew the country’s
   bilateral and multilateral commitments in these areas, and whereas authoritative reports
   have stated that the human rights situation in China is at its worst since the Tiananmen
   Square massacre; whereas China has regularly submitted resolutions to the UN Human
   Rights Council aimed at making ‘sovereignty, non-interference and mutual respect’
   fundamental non-negotiable principles and rendering the promotion and protection of
   human rights of individuals an afterthought;

J. whereas in December 2020 the EU and China agreed in principle to the EU-China
   Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI); whereas the ability of the European
   Parliament to duly analyse the CAI is significantly hindered by the Chinese sanctions,
   which prevent, as a minimum, the Subcommittee on Human Rights from working with
   Chinese experts; whereas it is not acceptable to deal with trade and investment relations
   outside the general context of human rights issues and the broader political relations;

K. whereas the imposition of sanctions by China is the latest episode of a gradual move of
   the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership towards a confrontational approach,
   including by targeting the EU with disinformation and cyber-attacks, while EU-China
   relations are increasingly strained on account of the actions against the Uyghur people and
   other ethnic minorities, the crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong and the increasingly
   confrontational approach in the Taiwan Strait; whereas given that the existing EU-China
   Strategy has revealed its limitations, EU-China relations may not continue business as
   usual;

L. whereas the Chinese sanctions against the MEPs have been followed by the decision of
   the Russian authorities of 30 April 2021 to impose sanctions against eight EU nationals,
   including the President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, and Vice-President of
   the Commission Věra Jourová;

M. whereas since the launch of the Chinese Government’s ‘Strike hard against violent
   terrorism’ campaign in 2014, which mainly targets Uyghur minorities in Xinjiang, more
   than one million people have been imprisoned in detention camps, called ‘political re-
   education’ or ‘training’ centres, which constitutes the largest mass incarceration system in
   the world; whereas the Uyghur population is a victim of the Chinese Government’s efforts

   to eradicate their unique identity and the right to existence as a population through torture,
   enforced disappearance, mass surveillance, cultural and religious erasure, the forced
   sterilisation of women, sexual violence, violations of reproductive rights, and family
   separation; whereas human rights organisations have assessed that these offences could
   constitute crimes against humanity under international law;

N. whereas the repression of the political opposition in Hong Kong has continued to worsen
   since Parliament’ resolution of 21 January 2021, with numerous sentences against pro-
   democracy activists and political representatives, such as Joshua Wong, Martin Lee,
   Jimmy Lai, Andy Li and Lester Shum, for their peaceful involvement in protests, and in
   some cases even with no evidence of any active role in the riots; whereas in March this
   year changes were introduced to Hong Kong’s electoral system in what is the most
   significant alteration to Hong Kong’s political system, adding a requirement of patriotism
   to the mainland and introducing a concentration of power and influence in the Hong Kong
   Election Committee, which will lead to a drastic reduction in the proportion of directly
   elected representatives in the Hong Kong Legislative Council;

O. whereas 10 EU Member States still have active extradition treaties with China, whereby
   Uyghur people, citizens of Hong Kong, Tibetans and Chinese dissidents in Europe can be
   extradited to stand political trial in China;

P. whereas Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong resident and Swedish citizen, remains incarcerated in
   spite of Parliament’s numerous calls for his immediate release;

1. Condemns in the strongest possible terms the baseless and arbitrary sanctions imposed by
   the Chinese authorities, which amount to an attack on freedom of speech, on academic
   freedom and on the international commitment to and understanding of universal human
   rights; urges the Chinese authorities to lift these unjustified sanctions;

2. Stands in full solidarity with the Members of this Parliament, with its Subcommittee on
   Human Rights, and with all other individuals and entities affected by the Chinese
   sanctions, namely the Political and Security Committee of the Council of the European
   Union, the members of the national parliaments, the Swedish and German academics, and
   the think tanks in Germany and Denmark; expresses full solidarity with MPs from non-EU
   countries that have also been targeted by sanctions, such as in the UK, Canada, the US and
   Australia;

3. Reaffirms that fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression, free participation in
   decision-making processes, academic freedom and the defence of human rights are pillars
   of our democracies and that these values will never be compromised in EU-China
   relations; stresses that intimidation attempts are futile and that, as elected Members of the
   European Parliament, we will continue to actively and unabatedly denounce and work on
   human rights violations and breaches of international law, and to urge the EU to keep
   respect for human rights at the core of all its external policies; considers these attacks
   from China to be a manifestation of the systemic rivalry dimension of EU-China relations;

4. Strongly condemns this new attempt, and previous attempts, by the Chinese state and non-
   state actors to interfere in the democratic life of the European Union and of its Member
   States and spread disinformation in public debates; considers the sanctions to be part of an
   effort to police speech about China worldwide and to determine what kind of speech and
   discussions would be allowed globally, and sees this effort as part of a totalitarian threat;

5. Reiterates its most serious concern about the various abuses of basic and human rights in
   China, violations of human dignity, of the rights to freedom of cultural expression and
   religious belief, and of the freedoms of speech, of peaceful assembly and of association,
   and in particular the systemic persecution of the Uyghur people, Tibetans, Mongols and
   other ethnic minorities, human rights defenders, social activists, religious groups,
   journalists, and petitioners and protesters against injustices, as well as the ever-increasing
   repression of all dissenting and opposition voices, especially in Hong Kong;

6. Recalls its position from its resolution of 17 December 2020 that violations in Xinjiang
   amount to crimes against humanity and highlights the increasing evidence of such crimes;
   urges the EU and its Member States to intensify efforts to reach enough international
   support for an independent UN investigation on Xinjiang; therefore welcomes the listing
   of four Chinese individuals and one entity from China under the EU Global Human Rights
   Sanctions Regime, as they are responsible for serious human rights violations in China;
   urges the Commission, the Council and the Member States to take all the necessary
   measures and to use all means of leverage at their disposal, notably economic ones, to
   persuade the Chinese Government to close the camps and to end all human rights
   violations in Xinjiang and other places, such as Tibet;

7. Regrets that several international companies, notably in the apparel and textiles sector,
   have been subject to an extensive and widespread boycott after expressing concern about
   the reports on forced labour in Xinjiang and taking the decision to cut supply-chain ties
   with Xinjiang and strongly condemns the aggressive political coercion exercised against
   them by the Chinese Government; reiterates its request that the Commission and the
   European External Action Service swiftly finalise a supply-chain business advisory with
   guidance for companies on the exposure to risk of using Uyghur forced labour and
   providing support in urgently identifying alternative sources of supply;

8. Is concerned that the retaliatory measures against the EU and Member State institutions
   and their work on human rights is part of a deliberate strategy to weaken human rights
   internationally and redefine those rights in a way so that they would ultimately be emptied
   of their original meaning; regrets that the approach taken and tools used by the EU so far
   have not yielded tangible progress in China’s human rights record, which has only
   deteriorated over the last decade; urges the Commission to develop and implement a
   holistic EU strategy with a view to pursuing genuine progress on human rights in China;

9. Considers that the Chinese retaliatory sanctions, which are not based on international law,
   constitute an important backsliding in EU-China relations; considers it crucial for the EU
   and all its institutions to stand united against this attack against European democracy and
   in defending our common values; calls on the Presidents of the Council and the
   Commission to issue a clear statement that China’s sanctions against elected politicians
   will not be tolerated; considers it appropriate and necessary that the VP/HR and EU
   Member States raise this issue in bilateral exchanges with their Chinese counterparts at all
   levels and asks that Parliament be kept informed of these efforts;

10. Takes the position that any consideration of the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on
    Investment (CAI), as well as any discussion on ratification by the European Parliament,
    has justifiably been frozen because of the Chinese sanctions in place; demands that China
    lift the sanctions before Parliament can deal with the CAI, without prejudice to the final
    outcome of the CAI ratification process; expects the Commission to consult with
    Parliament before taking any steps towards the conclusion and signature of the CAI; calls

   on the Commission to use the debate around the CAI as leverage to improve the protection
   of human rights and support for civil society in China and reminds the Commission that
   Parliament will take the human rights situation in China, including in Hong Kong, into
   account when asked to endorse the CAI;

11. Highlights the urgent need to re-balance EU-China relations through the adoption of a
    toolbox of autonomous measures including: legislation against distortive effects of foreign
    subsidies on the internal market; an international procurement instrument; supply-chain
    legislation with mandatory due diligence requirements which also provide for an import
    ban on forced labour goods; an enhanced and strengthened EU Foreign Investment
    Screening Regulation; an effective anti-coercion instrument; additional targeted measures
    under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, as necessary, in order to continue
    addressing repressions in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and aimed at China putting an end to
    all the violations; adequately address China’s cybersecurity threats, hybrid attacks and the
    civil-military fusion programme;

12. Urges the Chinese Government to ratify and implement International Labour Organization
    (ILO) Convention Nos 29 on Forced Labour, 105 on the Abolition of Forced Labour, 87
    on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise, and 98 on the Right to
    Organise and to Collective Bargaining; urges China to ratify the International Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights;

13. Calls on the Chinese and the Hong Kong authorities to restore confidence in Hong Kong’s
    democratic process and to immediately end the persecution of those who promote
    democratic values; deplores the lack of unity in the Council of the EU over the adoption
    of measures to address the crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong; urges the VP/HR and
    the Council to propose and adopt conclusions on Hong Kong irrespective of a lack of
    unanimous support and demands that Member States’ extradition treaties with China be
    suspended;

14. Underlines the need to set up a system to check whether entities operating on the EU
    internal market are directly or indirectly involved in human rights abuses in Xinjiang and
    to introduce trade-related measures such as exclusion from public procurement and other
    sanctions; insists that the procurement of exploitative technology which is deployed in
    situations of violations of human rights should be prevented in the EU at all levels and in
    all EU institutions;

15. Calls on the European Council to take a firm stance against the Chinese sanctions and to
    adopt conclusions on the matter; takes the view that these sanctions, as well as the
    negative evolution and deteriorations within China and of China as an international actor,
    should be adequately reflected and responded to in the ongoing review of the joint
    communication ‘EU-China – A Strategic Outlook’ with a view to moving towards a more
    assertive EU-China strategy with the goal of uniting all Member States;

16. Calls on the EU to increase its coordination and cooperation with the US within the
    framework of a Transatlantic Dialogue on China, including in regards to a coordinated
    approach to measures to address human rights violations and requests that this dialogue
    provide a strong parliamentary dimension;

17. Considers that other trade and investment agreements with regional partners, including
    Taiwan, should not be held hostage to the suspension of the CAI ratification;

18. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Vice-
    President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and
    Security Policy, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, and the
    Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of China.

–    having regard to the press statement of its Conference of Presidents of 6 July 2020,

–    having regard to the adoption of the National Security Law in Hong Kong by the
     Standing Committee of the China’s National People’s Congress on 30 June 2020,

–    having regard to the G7 Foreign Ministers’ statement of 17 June 2020 on Hong Kong,

–    having regard to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
     (HKSAR) adopted on 4 April 1990, which entered into force on 1 July 1997,

–    having regard to the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom and
     the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the question of Hong Kong of
     19 December 1984, also known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration,

–    having regard to the 13th annual Structured Dialogue that took place in Hong Kong on
     28 November 2019,

–    having regard to the joint communication from the Commission and the VP/HR of
     12 March 2019 entitled ‘EU-China – A strategic outlook’ (JOIN(2019)0005),

–    having regard to the EU’s ‘One China’ policy,

–    having regard to Rule 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas on 5 January 2021 the Hong Kong police arrested 53 representatives of the
     democratic opposition and activists on charges of subversion under the National
     Security Law (NSL) for Hong Kong; whereas among those detained were the organisers
     and candidates of last July’s democratic primaries in the run-up to the elections to the
     Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, former
     Legislative Council members, district councillors, and an American lawyer involved in
     the pro-democracy movement; whereas on the instructions of the Hong Kong Police,
     banks also froze HKD 1.6 million related to the 53 individuals; whereas in the
     meantime all but three of these individuals have been released on bail pending further
     investigation;

B.   whereas this was the latest in a long series of arrests of representatives and activists of
     the democratic opposition and other actions aimed at undermining democratic
     institutions in Hong Kong since the entry into force of the NSL on 1 July 2020; whereas
     93 opposition figures have been arrested under the law since its introduction; whereas
     on 1 September 2020 the UN human rights experts affirmed that the law ‘implicates
     both serious concerns of legality as well as undue limitations on freedom of opinion,
     expression and peaceful assembly’;

C.   whereas Hong Kong’s Security Minister has declared that those arrested were suspected
     of trying to paralyse the government through their plans to use their democratic rights
     and gain a majority of the seats in the legislature;

D.   whereas numerous pro-democracy figures have been subject to politically motivated
     disqualification from elected offices, based on a National People’s Congress resolution
     of 10 November 2020 to make patriotism a legal requirement for lawmakers, leading to
     the resignation of almost all opposition members from the Legislative Council; whereas
     Hong Kong’s previously independent judiciary is increasingly coming under attack by
     the Chinese Communist Party and the state-controlled press;

E.   whereas, on 15 January 2021, Hong Kong Broadband Network blocked a pro-
     democracy website at the request of the Hong Kong authorities under the NSL; whereas
     this first instance of internet censorship under the NSL raises concerns that the Hong
     Kong authorities plan on using this legislation to further limit freedom of expression
     and of information online; whereas this would have damaging consequences for both
     civil liberties and democracy;

F.   whereas the Hong Kong Government took the decision to postpone the Legislative
     Council elections originally scheduled for 6 September 2020 by one year, clearly in an
     effort to hamper the opposition, which for the first time had stood a real chance of
     winning a majority; whereas immediately after the entry into force of the NSL, Hong
     Kong leader Carrie Lam declared that the primaries were illegal and might violate the
     NSL;

G.   whereas, on 23 August 2020, the Chinese authorities apprehended 12 Hong Kong
     activists who were allegedly trying to flee Hong Kong by boat; whereas 10 of the 12
     activists were handed down prison sentences ranging between 7 months and 3 years on
     charges of illegally crossing the border in a trial that did not respect the defendants’
     right to due process; whereas one of these activists, Kok Tsz-Lun, is a 19-year-old
     student and a dual Chinese and Portuguese national, and is therefore an EU citizen;
     whereas the defendants were detained, held incommunicado and put on trial in
     Shenzhen; whereas they were also denied the possibility of choosing their
     representation;

H.   whereas they were detained and their trial held in Shenzhen was in violation of the
     principles of a fair trial and due process; whereas, on 15 January 2021, Chinese human
     rights lawyer Lu Siwei had his licence to practice law revoked by the Sichuan
     Provincial Justice Department for representing one of these 12 activists; whereas human
     rights lawyer Ren Quanniu faced a hearing in the Henan Provincial Judicial Department
     on 19 January 2021 to contest the Judicial Department’s decision to initiate the process
     to revoke his licence over the same issue; whereas both lawyers are at risk of losing
     their licence after trying to represent Hong Kong activists who were intercepted by the
     Chinese authorities while attempting to flee to Taiwan by boat; whereas 10 diplomats,
     including some representing EU Member States, were barred from observing Lu
     Siwei’s hearing in Chengdu on 13 January 2021;

I.   whereas on 10 August 2020 Jimmy Lay, the media mogul and founder of the pro-
     democracy newspaper Apple Daily was arrested on grounds of violating the NSL;

J.   whereas the NSL is in clear violation of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the

     1990 Basic Law of the HKSAR, which guarantees the autonomy and the independence
     of the executive, legislative and judiciary, as well as basic rights and freedoms such as
     freedom of speech, assembly, association and of the press for 50 years after handover of
     sovereignty; whereas the NSL also prevents Hong Kong from abiding by its
     international human rights obligations, including the International Covenant on Civil
     and Political Rights (ICCPR), whose implementation by Hong Kong will soon be
     reviewed;

K.   whereas Human Rights Watch’s annual report states that China is in the middle of its
     darkest period for human rights since the Tiananmen Square massacre;

L.   whereas the European Union continues to have deep concerns regarding the PRC NSL
     for Hong Kong; whereas this is a sensitive issue, with far-reaching consequences for
     Hong Kong and its people, for EU and foreign citizens, for EU and international civil
     society organisations, and for business confidence in Hong Kong; whereas the NSL
     increases the risks faced by EU citizens in Hong Kong;

M.   whereas the EU has always strongly supported the ‘One Country, Two Systems’
     principle and the preservation of Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy in line with the
     Basic Law and international commitments; whereas in the current circumstances these
     principles are on the verge of being irreversibly undermined;

N.   whereas in December 2020 the EU and China agreed in principle on the EU-China
     Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI);

1.   Calls for the immediate and unconditional release of those arrested in Hong Kong in the
     first two weeks of 2021, and of all those previously arrested on charges pursuant to the
     NSL, and for all charges against them to be dropped; urges the authorities to respect
     Hong Kong’s rule of law, human rights, democratic principles and high degree of
     autonomy under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle, as enshrined in the Hong
     Kong Basic Law and in line with domestic and international obligations;

2.   Calls for the immediate and unconditional release of the Hong Kong activists detained
     on 23 August 2020 while allegedly trying to flee by boat, and for all charges against
     them to be dropped; calls on the European External Action Service (EEAS), through the
     EU Delegation in China, to continue providing due assistance to Kok Tsz-Lun, a dual
     Chinese and Portuguese national and, therefore, an EU citizen, who was also one of the
     10 sentenced in Shenzhen; calls on the Chinese authorities to immediately reinstate the
     licences of their defenders, human rights lawyers Lu Siwei and Ren Quanniu;

3.   Calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all peaceful Hong Kong protesters
     arrested in recent years, including Joshua Wong, Ivan Lam, and Agnes Chow, and for
     all charges against them to be dropped; calls for independent, impartial, effective and
     prompt investigations into the use of force by the Hong Kong police against protesters;

4.   Calls on the Hong Kong authorities to immediately refrain from making further use of
     the NSL to suppress the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and
     association; stresses the importance of preventing, as a next step, the disqualification of
     district councillors, as well as any change to the electoral law that would further limit
     the space of the pro-democracy camp, which runs counter to the legal guarantees of the
     Hong Kong Basic Law and to international obligations and standards;

5.    Calls for the full withdrawal of the law entitled ‘Decision of the National People’s
      Congress on Establishing and Completing the Hong Kong’s Special Administrative
      Region’s Legal System and Implementation Mechanisms for the Preservation of
      National Security’, which damages Hong Kong’s international status by eroding its
      autonomy and democracy, the independence of the justice system and its respect for
      human rights; underlines that the people of Hong Kong should enjoy the freedoms and
      high degree of autonomy guaranteed under both the Basic Law and the ICCPR to which
      Hong Kong is a party;

6.    Stresses that the introduction of the NSL is a breach of the PRC’s commitments and
      obligations under international law, namely the Sino-British Joint Declaration, prevents
      the establishment of a relationship of trust between China and the EU, and undermines
      future cooperation;

7.    Expresses concern at the increasing number of attacks against the Hong Kong judiciary
      by the Chinese Communist Party and the state-controlled Chinese press aimed at
      directly calling judicial independence into question; is concerned that the NSL could be
      further invoked, as a next step, to undermine the independence of the judiciary of Hong
      Kong, since the Chief Executive is being given the power to appoint judges to prosecute
      national security cases, and since those charged could be extradited to mainland China
      and tried in Chinese courts;

8.    Strongly welcomes the decision by the UK Government to create a pathway to
      citizenship for the more than one million Hong Kong residents who hold British
      National Overseas (BNO) passports; condemns the threats by China to withdraw its
      recognition of such passports as a valid travel document and is concerned at the latest
      information that China is allegedly considering excluding BNO passport holders from
      Hong Kong public office or even denying them the right to vote in Hong Kong
      elections; calls on the Council, the EEAS and the Commission to improve coordination
      in order to achieve the successful and effective implementation of the package of
      measures for Hong Kong adopted in July 2020; calls on the EEAS to provide a more
      transparent assessment of these measures, including the urgency of setting up a ‘lifeboat
      scheme’ for citizens of Hong Kong in the event of a further deterioration of human
      rights and fundamental freedoms;

9.    Urges all EU and European diplomatic personnel to do everything they can to provide
      protection and support to peaceful activists in Hong Kong, including by attending trials,
      requesting prison visits and consistently and resolutely reaching out to the local
      authorities, applying in full the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders and other
      relevant EU policies, including the new EU Action Plan on Human Rights and
      Democracy;

10.   Is deeply disturbed by the reports that the Hong Kong authorities are considering
      prosecuting Danish lawmakers Uffe Elbæk and Katarina Ammitzbøll for helping Hong
      Kong activist Ted Hui to go into exile in the UK; believes that the proposed charges
      against the Danish lawmakers are illegitimate and false, and expresses strong concern at
      the determination of the Chinese Communist Party to clamp down on Hong Kong
      voices of dissent across the democratic world through an extraterritorial application of
      the NSL; urges China to release unjustly detained EU citizens, such as Irish citizen
      Richard O’Halloran; calls, furthermore, on the Commission to conduct a risk
      assessment of how Hong Kong’s NSL could affect European citizens;

11.   Remains particularly outraged at the continuing detention of Swedish publisher Gui
      Minhai, and urges robust and steady intervention by the EU and the Member States at
      the highest level to secure his release; calls for the release of dual Hong Kong-
      Portuguese national Kok Tsz-Lun, and urges that he be allowed access to Portuguese
      consular staff and the counsel of his choice;

12.   Welcomes the decisions by EU Member States and other international partners to
      suspend extradition treaties with Hong Kong; highlights the importance of continuing to
      observe trials and of continuing to assess and prepare responses to the possible
      implications of the NSL outside Hong Kong; reiterates its call on the Member States to
      suspend their extradition treaties with the PRC, to prevent the extradition of, for
      example, Uyghurs, citizens of Hong Kong, Tibetans or Chinese dissidents in Europe to
      stand political trial in the PRC;

13.   Condemns the role of European-based banks in aiding the Chinese authorities’ use of
      the NSL by freezing the assets and bank accounts belonging to former pro-democracy
      lawmakers and religious leaders;

14.   Recalls that Hong Kong has enjoyed open internet access, but is concerned that the NSL
      grants the police the power to order internet providers to block websites; expresses its
      strong concern at the recent declarations by the internet service provider Hong Kong
      Broadband Network that it intended to reject any sites that could incite ‘illegal acts’
      based on the NSL, and, consequently, at the tangible risk that Hong Kong could be
      integrated into the Chinese firewall; urges the Hong Kong authorities to immediately
      withdraw all takedown orders which have already been issued and to restore full
      internet accessibility;

15.   Urges the Council to intensify its discussions on and assessment of the package of
      measures on Hong Kong and to promptly consider the introduction of targeted sanctions
      against individuals in Hong Kong and China, including Carrie Lam, Teresa Yeuk-wah
      Cheng, Xia Baolong, Xiaoming Zhang, Luo Huining, Zheng Yanxiong, Ping-kien Tang,
      Wai-Chung Lo and Ka-chiu Lee, under the EU human rights global sanction regime,
      taking into account, in the course of 2021, the imperative to restore civil and political
      rights, and compliance with the condition that the representatives of the democratic
      opposition be freed and allowed to take part in the forthcoming elections, fully in line
      with the Basic Law of the HKSAR;

16.   Regrets the fact that the decision on a political conclusion of the CAI has not reflected
      Parliament’s requests in previous resolutions on Hong Kong to use investment
      negotiations as a leverage tool aimed at preserving Hong Kong’s high degree of
      autonomy, as well as its basic rights and freedoms; regrets the fact that, by rushing to
      reach this agreement while not taking concrete action against ongoing grave human
      right violations, for example in Hong Kong, Xinjiang province and Tibet, the EU risks
      undermining its credibility as a global human rights actor; points out that Parliament
      will carefully scrutinise the agreement, including its provisions on labour rights and
      reminds the Commission that it will take the human rights situation in China, including
      in Hong Kong, into account when asked to endorse the investment agreement or future
      trade deals with the PRC;

17.   Urges the EU and all its Member States to act in a united and resolute fashion towards
      the establishment of a UN independent monitoring body on China, by proactively

      expanding coalitions of like-minded countries by holding an ‘Arria’ formula meeting on
      China at the UN Security Council, by urging the UN High Commissioner for Human
      Rights to launch a Human Rights Council investigation into the abuses, and by urging
      the UN Secretary-General to appoint a Special Envoy on China; urges the EEAS and
      the Member States which are members of the UN Human Rights Council to step up
      their efforts to publicly raise concerns about China’s rights violations, for example by
      taking the initiative to call for a Special Session on the human rights situation in China,
      including Hong Kong, during the 2021 Council cycle, and underlines that China’s
      membership of the Council requires that it be held to a higher standard of human rights
      security;

18.   Calls for the EU to push for the UN Secretary-General or the UN High Commissioner
      for Human Rights to appoint a UN Special Envoy or Special Rapporteur on the situation
      in Hong Kong, joining in with the initiative by the Chairs of the UK, Canadian,
      Australian, and New Zealand Foreign Affairs Committees; calls on the Council and the
      VP/HR to work with the international community to establish an international contact
      group on Hong Kong;

19.   Calls on the international community to honour its promises to the people of Hong
      Kong and take urgent and unprecedented action to hold China to account for these
      violations of international law; reiterates its call for the EU and the Member States to
      consider bringing a case before the International Court of Justice on the grounds that
      China’s decision to impose the NSL on Hong Kong and its subsequent application
      violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the ICCPR;

20.   Welcomes the newly established bilateral EU-US Dialogue on China, launched on 23
      October 2020; calls for enhanced coordination with international partners, including the
      incoming US administration, with regard to all aspects of relations with the PRC and
      Hong Kong; insists that human rights, with a particular focus on the situation in Hong
      Kong, feature prominently on the agenda of the forthcoming EU-US Dialogue;

21.   Observes that the PRC’s policy of abandoning the ‘One Country, Two Systems’
      approach has greatly alienated the people of Taiwan, and emphasises its willingness to
      cooperate with international partners in order to help secure democracy in Taiwan;

22.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign
      Affairs and Security Policy, the Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of
      China, and the Chief Executive and the Assembly of the Hong Kong Special
      Administrative Region.

    entitled ‘EU-China – A strategic outlook’ (JOIN(2019)0005),

–   having regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which

–   having regard to the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and

–   having regard to the EU Guidelines on the death penalty, on torture and other cruel

–   having regard to Article 36 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, which

    which upholds the rights of minority ethnicities,

–   having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of
    16 December 1966, which China signed in 1998, but which it has never ratified,

–   having regard to the Protocol of 2014 to the International Labour Organization (ILO)
    Forced Labour Convention of 1930, which has not been signed by China,

–    having regard to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights of 2011,

–    having regard to the reports of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) entitled
     ‘Uyghurs for sale – “Re-education”, forced labour and surveillance beyond Xinjiang’
     and ‘Cultural erasure – Tracing the destruction of Uyghur and Islamic spaces in
     Xinjiang’ published in 2020, as well as its ‘Xinjiang Data Project’,

–    having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948,

–    having regard to Rule 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
     should remain at the centre of the long-standing relationship between the EU and China,
     in line with the EU’s commitment to upholding these values in its external action and
     China’s expressed interest in adhering to them in its own development and international
     cooperation;

B.   whereas the situation in Xinjiang, where more than 10 million Muslim Uyghurs and
     Kazakhs live, has rapidly deteriorated, particularly since the launch of the Chinese
     Government’s ‘Strike Hard against Violent Terrorism’ campaign in 2014, and whereas
     Uyghurs and other primarily Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur
     Autonomous Region have been subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, egregious
     restrictions on religious practice and culture, and a digitalised surveillance system so
     pervasive that every aspect of daily life is monitored – through facial recognition
     cameras, mobile phone scans, the large-scale illegal collection, aggregation and
     processing of personal data, and an extensive and intrusive police presence; whereas
     there has been a general strengthening of the Chinese regime and a toughening of the
     treatment of minorities, in particular of Uyghurs, Tibetans and Mongolians, with the
     aim of assimilating them through the imposition of the Chinese majority lifestyle and
     communist ideology; whereas predictive policing platforms such as the Integrated Joint
     Operation Platform have been extensively used by the police to track suspicious
     individuals based on everyday, lawful and non-violent behaviour;

C.   whereas according to credible reports, more than one million people, are, or have been,
     detained in what are being called ‘political re-education’ centres, in the largest mass
     incarceration of an ethnic minority population in the world today; whereas the
     internment camp system in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is expanding,
     with more than 380 suspected detention facilities having been newly built or expanded
     since 2017, and at least 61 detention sites newly constructed or expanded between July
     2019 and July 2020;

D.   whereas the suffering of the Uyghurs also extends to the younger generation; whereas
     according to reports, young children have been sent to state-run orphanages even if only
     one of their parents has been detained in the internment camps; whereas according to
     research findings, by the end of 2019, over 880 000 Uyghur children had been placed in
     boarding facilities; whereas credible research shows that the Chinese authorities have
     implemented an official scheme of targeted birth prevention measures against Uyghur
     women in an effort to reduce Uyghur birth rates; whereas, as part of this scheme, the
     Chinese authorities are systematically subjecting Uyghur women of childbearing age to
     forced abortions, intrauterine injections and sterilisation, with 80 % of all new
     intrauterine device (IUD) placements in China in 2018 performed in the Uyghur region,

     despite the fact that it makes up only 1.8 % of China’s population; whereas such
     measures to prevent births within the Uyghur population could meet the criteria for
     belonging to the worst crimes against humanity;

E.   whereas in August 2018, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial
     Discrimination challenged the Government of the People’s Republic of China over
     abuses in Xinjiang, including the establishment of mass arbitrary detention camps;
     whereas in September 2018, during her first ever speech in the role, the UN High
     Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet noted the ‘deeply disturbing
     allegations of large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uyghurs and other Muslim
     communities, in so-called re-education camps across Xinjiang’;

F.   whereas the new regulations on religious affairs in China that took effect on 1 February
     2018 are more restrictive towards religious groups and activities, and force them to fall
     more closely into line with party policies; whereas freedom of religion and conscience
     has reached a new low point since the start of the economic reforms and the opening up
     of China in the late 1970s; whereas China is home to one of the largest populations of
     religious prisoners; whereas credible reports have revealed the deliberate and systematic
     destruction of mosques, churches and other places of worship, mostly since 2017,
     reducing their numbers to the lowest level since the Cultural Revolution;

G.   whereas China has not yet ratified four of the eight ILO Fundamental Conventions,
     namely Convention no 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to
     Organise, Convention no 98 on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining,
     Convention no 29 on Forced Labour and Convention no 105 on the Abolition of Forced
     Labour; whereas China has ratified Convention no 111 on Discrimination (Employment
     and Occupation) and Convention no 100 on Equal Remuneration; whereas WTO
     agreements allow for the adoption of trade measures relating to the products of prison
     labour;

H.   whereas, in parallel to the ‘Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism’, labour
     transfer programmes have increased since 2014, suggesting they have become a
     political priority for the Chinese Government as a tool of poverty alleviation in the
     Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; whereas there are several credible reports of
     forced Uyghur labour in production chains in the clothing, technology and automotive
     sectors, including the March 2020 report of the ASPI, which identified 27 factories in
     nine Chinese provinces that are using the labour of at least 80 000 Uyghurs transferred
     from Xinjiang between 2017 and 2019; whereas these factories supply at least 82 global
     brands, including those owned by many European multinational companies;

I.   whereas China is one of the world’s largest cotton producers, with the Xinjiang Uyghur
     Autonomous Region accounting for over 20 % of global cotton production; whereas
     China is the largest producer and exporter of yarn, and the largest producer and exporter
     of textiles and apparel; whereas the Chinese Government plans to double manufacturing
     capacity in the Uyghur Region by 2025, with apparel and textiles forming a key element
     of that plan; whereas three Uyghur regions alone mobilised at least 570 000 persons into
     cotton-picking operations through the government’s coercive labour training and
     transfer scheme in 2018 alone; whereas Xinjiang’s total labour transfer of ethnic
     minorities into cotton picking likely exceeds that figure by several hundred thousand,
     making forced labour an intrinsic and generalised characteristic of cotton harvesting in
     the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; whereas 84 % of Chinese cotton comes from

     the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which means that the yarn, textiles and
     garments made with Chinese cotton are at extraordinarily high risk of being tainted with
     forced and prison labour, whether manufactured in China or anywhere else in the world;

J.   whereas more than 80 international brand-name corporations have been reported to
     allegedly profit directly or indirectly from Uyghur forced labour in their supply chains;
     whereas the current context of oppression prevents independent investigations and
     audits from being conducted in the Uyghur region;

K.   whereas no reliable means are available to companies to verify that any workplace in
     the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is free of forced labour or to prevent the use
     of forced labour in these workplaces in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business
     and Human Rights and human rights due diligence standards;

L.   whereas under the current EU legislation (either at EU or national levels), companies
     have no legal responsibility to take action to prevent themselves from contributing to
     human rights abuses in their supply chains; whereas the EU Non-Financial Reporting
     Directive imposes a reporting obligation on companies, but does not require them to
     take steps to prevent harm in their supply chains or allows for them to be held
     accountable;

M.   whereas on the occasion of his hearing in its Committee on International Trade,
     Executive Vice-President Dombrovskis indicated that combating forced labour is a
     priority for the EU and that, also in the framework of the EU-China Comprehensive
     Agreement on Investment, EU investment will have to respect the relevant ILO
     conventions on forced labour;

N.   whereas its Committee on Legal Affairs is currently working on an initiative on
     ‘corporate due diligence and corporate accountability’; whereas the Council published
     its conclusions on human rights and decent work in global supply chains on 1 December
     2020, which call on the Commission to table a proposal for an EU legal framework on
     sustainable corporate governance, including cross-sector corporate due diligence
     obligations along global supply chains; whereas the Commission announced that it will
     put forward a legislative proposal on ‘Sustainable Corporate Governance’ in the second
     quarter of 2021, which will address the need for human rights due diligence across
     value chains;

O.   whereas the Council has adopted a decision and a regulation establishing the EU global
     human rights sanction regime which enables the EU to impose restrictive measures on
     targeted individuals, entities and bodies, including states and non-state actors,
     responsible for, involved in or associated with serious human rights violations and
     abuses worldwide, including slavery;

P.   whereas the US Congress passed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act in 2019;
     whereas on 22 September 2020, the US House of Representatives adopted the Uyghur
     Forced Labor Prevention Act that imposes various restrictions related to the Xinjiang
     Uyghur Autonomous Region, including by prohibiting certain imports from Xinjiang
     and imposing sanctions on the individuals and entities responsible for human rights
     violations there;

Q.   whereas China has made progress in the economic and social fields, but is dismally

     failing to guarantee basic international standards of human rights and fundamental
     freedoms;

R.   whereas in its Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy, the EU pledged
     to step up its efforts to promote human rights, democracy and the rule of law across all
     aspects of its external action, and to place human rights at the centre of its relations with
     all third countries, including its strategic partners;

1.   Strongly condemns the government-led system of forced labour, in particular the
     exploitation of Uyghur, ethnic Kazakh and Kyrgyz, and other Muslim minority groups,
     in factories both within and outside of internment camps in Xinjiang, as well as the
     transfer of forced labourers to other Chinese administrative divisions, and the fact that
     well-known European brands and companies have been benefiting from the use of
     forced labour; calls on the relevant actors from the private sector to assess their
     engagements in Xinjiang, to exercise their corporate responsibility, to conduct
     independent audits of human rights compliance in their full supply chains, and to
     terminate business relations where these are found to abet human rights violations or,
     where it is impossible to ascertain whether there have been violations, either directly or
     indirectly, through the activity of one of their suppliers or business relationships on their
     value chain in China;

2.   Is deeply concerned about the increasingly oppressive regime that many religious and
     ethnic minorities, in particular the Uyghurs and the Kazakhs, are facing, which violate
     their human dignity, as well as their rights to freedom of cultural expression and
     religious belief, to freedom of speech and expression, and to peaceful assembly and
     association; deplores the worsening human rights situation across mainland China and
     in Hong Kong, and demands that the Chinese authorities respect fundamental freedoms;

3.   Deeply deplores the ongoing persecution and the serious and systematic human rights
     violations that amount to crimes against humanity; urges the Chinese Government to
     put an immediate end to the practice of arbitrary detention without charge, trial or
     conviction for criminal offences of members of the Uyghur and other Muslim
     minorities, to close all camps and detention centres, and to immediately and
     unconditionally release those detained; calls on the Chinese authorities to cease
     government-sponsored programmes of forced labour and mass sterilisation; calls on the
     Chinese authorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to provide information
     about the location and medical conditions of those detained, and to immediately release
     them if there is no evidence of actual criminal activity;

4.   Strongly condemns the extensive use of digital surveillance technologies to monitor and
     control the population in Xinjiang, and the most recently revealed tests of facial
     recognition software which could send ‘Uyghur alarms’ to government authorities when
     its camera systems identify members of the Uyghur minority; regrets the fact that China
     is not complying with its own commitments entered into by adhering to the
     Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles on human-
     centred artificial intelligence and by having subscribed to the G20 declaration of June
     2019, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to continue calling on China
     to adhere to its own commitments in this regard;

5.   Calls on the Chinese authorities to allow free, meaningful and unhindered access to
     Xinjiang province, and unrestricted access to the internment camps for journalists and

      international observers, including to EU officials, following President Xi Jinping’s
      invitation during the EU-China Summit of 14 September 2020, to the UN High
      Commissioner for Human Rights, the EU Special Representative for Human Rights and
      the mandate holders of the UN Human Rights Council Special Procedures; calls for the
      EU and the Member States to continue insisting on the establishment of a UN fact-
      finding mission to Xinjiang and the appointment of a Special Envoy;

6.    Requests China to allow a mission from the European Parliament to Xinjiang on the
      condition that it is given free and unrestricted access, while guaranteeing confidentiality
      and safety for the local population;

7.    Strongly condemns the reported massive campaign by the Chinese Communist Party to
      suppress Uyghur birth rates in Xinjiang, and calls on the Chinese authorities to put an
      immediate end to any measures aimed at preventing births in the Uyghur population,
      including forced sterilisations, abortions or sanctions against birth control violations;

8.    Urges the Chinese Government to ratify and implement ILO Convention n°29 on
      Forced Labour, ILO Convention n°105 on the Abolition of Forced Labour, ILO
      Convention n°87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise
      and ILO Convention n°98 on the Right to Organise and to Collective Bargaining; urges
      China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;

9.    Expresses deep concern over reports concerning the harassment of Uyghurs abroad by
      the Chinese authorities in order to force them to act as informants against other
      Uyghurs, return to Xinjiang or remain silent about the situation there, sometimes by
      detaining their family members; calls on the Commission and all EU Member States to
      investigate these reports as a matter of urgency, to ensure the protection of members of
      the Xinjiang diaspora, and to expedite asylum requests from Uyghurs and other Turkic
      Muslims; welcomes the decision taken by Germany and Sweden to suspend the return
      of all ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs or other Turkic Muslims to China in view of the risk of
      arbitrary detention, torture or other ill-treatment;

10.   Calls on the Commission and the Member States to start a dialogue with states where
      Uyghurs are at risk of deportation to China to prevent such deportations from occurring;
      calls on members of the Council to suspend their extradition treaties with the People’s
      Republic of China, to prevent the extradition of Uyghurs, citizens of Hong Kong,
      Tibetans, or Chinese dissidents in Europe to stand political trial in the People’s
      Republic of China;

11.   Calls on the EU to proactively work towards an independent UN inquiry on China with
      a view to ensuring accountability for the crimes committed;

12.   Express its deep concern at the Chinese state’s measures to ensure the ‘comprehensive
      supervision’ of Xinjiang through the installation of Skynet electronic surveillance in
      major urban areas and GPS trackers in all motor vehicles, the use of facial recognition
      scanners at checkpoints and train and petrol stations, using software based on artificial
      intelligence camera systems aimed at identifying Uyghurs and other members of ethnic
      minority groups, and the blood collection campaign by Xinjiang police in order to
      further expand China’s DNA database; expresses deep concern at the latest revelations
      concerning a list containing details of more than 2 000 Uighur detainees held in Aksu
      prefecture between 2016 and 2018; expresses further concerns that China is exporting

      such technologies to authoritarian regimes around the world; calls for the EU and the
      Member States to monitor the acquisition and development of these technologies, and
      the activity of their providers, and to refrain from giving them access to EU and national
      public funding and public procurement;

13.   Criticises the procurement of thermal cameras from Hikivision by Parliament’s
      administration and by the Commission; insists on the introduction of a circumspect
      procurement policy that takes human rights concerns duly into account; urges
      Parliament’s administration and its President to immediately sever any direct or indirect
      business relationship with Hikivision, and to improve the transparency of its
      procurement activities;

14.   Calls on the Chinese authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the Uyghur
      scholar and Sakharov Prize 2019 winner Ilham Tohti, and to ensure, in the meantime,
      that he has regular and unrestricted access to his family and the lawyers of his choice,
      and that he is not subjected to torture or other ill-treatment; calls for an immediate,
      effective and impartial investigation into the alleged torture of Ilham Tohti and for those
      responsible to be brought to justice;

15.   Welcomes the inclusion in the Commission’s Work Programme for 2021 of a legislative
      initiative on mandatory human rights supply chain due diligence legislation; calls on the
      Commission to adopt relevant legislative proposals during the second quarter of 2021 at
      the latest and as planned, comprising three distinct, yet mutually reinforcing proposals
      on directors’ duties and sustainable corporate governance, on corporate human rights
      and environmental due diligence, and on the reform of the Non-Financial Reporting
      Directive; is of the view that, in order to effectively address the issue of forced labour
      and other human rights violations in companies’ supply chains, such legislation should
      also include a prohibition of placing the relevant goods on the EU market; recalls, in
      this respect, its position in its recent resolution on the Trade Policy Review, calling for
      complementary measures, such as banning the import of products linked to severe
      human rights violations such as forced labour or child labour;

16.   Calls on the Member States, in accordance with their competences and national
      circumstances, to step up their efforts to effectively implement the UN Guiding
      Principles on Business and Human Rights, including through new or updated National
      Action Plans containing a mix of voluntary and mandatory measures;

17.   Is of the opinion that the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment with China must
      include adequate commitments to respect international conventions against forced
      labour; considers, in particular, that China should therefore ratify ILO Conventions 29
      and 105;

18.   Welcomes the recent agreement reached by the co-legislators on the reform of the EU
      Dual Use Regulation on the grounds of national security and human rights
      considerations;

19.   Urges the Commission, the Council and the Member States to take all necessary
      measures to persuade the Chinese Government to close the camps and to end all human
      rights violations in Xinjiang and in other places, such as Tibet; calls for the EU and its
      Member States to reiterate this message to the Chinese Government on every occasion
      and at the highest levels; regrets the fact that the approach taken and the tools used by

      the EU so far have not yielded tangible progress in China’s human rights record, which
      has only deteriorated over the last decade; urges the Commission to devise and
      implement a holistic EU strategy with a view to securing genuine progress on human
      rights in China; urges the Chinese authorities to continue to implement the national
      reforms required to ratify the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
      which was signed by China in 1998, and to implement the recommendations of UN
      human rights bodies;

20.   Welcomes the adoption of the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime on 7
      December 2020; calls on the Member States and the High Representative of the Union
      for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to swiftly evaluate the adoption of sanctions
      against the Chinese officials and state-led entities, such as Xinjiang Production and
      Construction Corporation, responsible for devising and implementing the policy of mass
      detention of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, for the use of forced
      labour, and for orchestrating the severe repression of religious freedom, freedom of
      movement and other basic rights in the region and in other places, such as Tibet;

21.   Calls on the Council and Commission to implement the package of measures agreed in
      July, including the creation of a ‘lifeboat scheme’ for oppressed people in China,
      following the further deterioration in human rights and fundamental freedoms;

22.   Reiterates its support for the forthcoming EU-US Dialogue on China, and urges that
      human rights should feature prominently on its agenda; calls for greater coordination
      among democracies in implementing sanctions and other measures to address human
      rights violations in mainland China and Hong Kong, as well as the geopolitical
      challenges posed by the People’s Republic of China;

23.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      Vice President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign
      Affairs and Security Policy, and the Government and Parliament of the People’s
      Republic of China.

–    having regard to the joint reports of the Commission and the VP/HR of 8 May 2019
     (JOIN(2019)008), 26 April 2017 (JOIN(2016)0016) and 25 April 2016

     and the other 20 similar reports preceding it,

–    having regard to the 13th annual Structured Dialogue that took place in Hong Kong on
     28 November 2019, and the 37th EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in Brussels
     on 1 and 2 April 2019,

–    having regard to the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom and
     the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong of 19
     December 1984, also known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration,

–    having regard to the EU’s ‘One China’ policy,

–    having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948,

–    having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 16
     December 1966,

–    having regard to Rule 132(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration guaranteed, and the 1990 Basic Law of
     the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) stipulates that Hong Kong
     will maintain the autonomy and independence of the executive, legislature and judiciary
     as well as basic rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, of assembly, of
     association and of press for 50 years after the handover of sovereignty; whereas the
     Basic Law of the HKSAR lays down provisions guaranteeing its autonomy in
     maintaining security and order, and to enact legislation on any act of treason, secession,
     sedition or subversion against the Central People’s Government; whereas both the Joint
     Declaration and the Basic Law enshrine the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle’ as
     agreed between China and the United Kingdom; whereas the PRC has also signed and
     ratified international agreements guaranteeing these rights and has thus acknowledged
     the significance and universality of human rights; whereas Hong Kong is party to the
     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR);

B.   whereas the EU advocates the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy
     and the rule of law as core values guiding our long-standing relationship with the
     People’s Republic of China, in line with the EU’s commitment to uphold these values in
     its external action; whereas the EU remains a strong supporter of the continued stability
     and prosperity of Hong Kong under the ‘One Country Two Systems’ principle and
     attaches great importance to the preservation of Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy,
     in line with the Basic Law and with international commitments, as well as to the respect
     for this principle; whereas in particular since the Occupy Protest, the ‘One Country,
     Two Systems’ principle is being eroded through the interference of Chinese authorities,
     political leaders have been imprisoned, free speech has been eroded, enforced
     disappearances have increased, and bookshops and media outlets have been bought by
     owners friendly to Beijing;

C.   whereas the Chinese National People’s Congress (NPC) adopted a resolution on 28 May
     2020 authorising the NPC Standing Committee to adopt legislation targeting separatism,
     subversion of state power, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong, and
     mentions other measures to be taken, including national security education, the
     establishment of national security organs of the Central People’s Government (CPG) in
     Hong Kong, and regular reporting by the Chief Executive to the CPG on Hong Kong’s
     performance in fulfilling its duty to safeguard national security;

D.   whereas the international community sees this decision as a threat to the ‘One Country,
     Two Systems’ principle, believes that it ignores the provisions of the Basic Law and the
     Joint Sino-British Declaration, goes against Hong Kong’s commitments on human
     rights, entirely bypasses Hong Kong’s own legislative process, and constitutes the latest
     and most blatant of Beijing’s continuing attempts ongoing for years to curb the freedom
     and autonomy of Hong Kong and its citizens’ civil liberties;

E.   whereas over recent years, the people of Hong Kong have taken to the streets in
     unprecedented numbers, exercising their fundamental right to assemble and to protest;
     whereas instead of reducing the ongoing tensions in Hong Kong’s politics and society,
     this law further intensifies existing unrest; whereas, in February 2019, the HKSAR
     administration proposed the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in
     Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 to amend the Fugitive Offenders
     Ordinance against massive opposition from Hong Kong citizens, sparking the massive
     protests in Hong Kong in 2019 and 2020, but was later withdrawn after 20 weeks of
     protests;

F.   whereas during April and May 2020 Beijing redoubled its efforts to impose its rule on
     Hong Kong while silencing, arresting and prosecuting hundreds of pro-democracy
     activists and opposition groups; whereas Hong Kong police have enjoyed impunity for
     all its brutality against demonstrators in 2019 and 2020; whereas more than 360 Hong
     Kong pro-democracy activists were arrested on 27 May 2020 amid demonstrations
     against the Chinese anti-sedition law; whereas the Hong Kong police used social
     distancing measures related to COVID-19 as a pretext to use unnecessary and excessive
     force against the peaceful vast majority, including tear gas, rubber bullets, beanbags and
     pepper spray;

G.   whereas on 20 April 2020 Members of the European Parliament urged the Chief
     Executive to ensure that charges against 15 pro-democracy activists who participated in
     peaceful protests in Hong Kong in 2019 are dropped; whereas on 13 May 2020 United
     Nations human rights experts urged the authorities of the Hong Kong Special
     Administrative Region to immediately drop the criminal prosecution of the 15 pro-
     democracy activists;

H.   whereas under the proposed national security plan, activist groups could be banned and
     prosecuted, Courts could impose long jail sentences for national security violations,
     China’s security agencies could operate openly in the city, and a new ban on terrorism
     will give to the Chinese authorities, security and military forces ample and unchecked
     discretion to operate in Hong Kong; whereas mainland China’s enforcement agencies
     have reportedly already been operating in Hong Kong illegally; whereas any operation
     of PRC law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong is a serious violation of the ‘One
     Country, Two Systems’ principle;

I.   whereas Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam defended the legislation proposed by Beijing
     admitting that no public consultation will take place in Hong Kong on the security plan,
     while also claiming that rights and freedoms are not absolute; whereas in a letter
     published in newspapers on 29 May 2020 the Chief Executive appealed to Hong Kong
     citizens for their full understanding and staunch support for the Decision passed by the
     NPC;

J.   whereas the PRC State Council issued a white paper on the practice of the ‘One
     Country, Two Systems’ policy in Hong Kong on 10 June 2014, stressing that the
     autonomy of the HKSAR is ultimately subject to central PRC Government
     authorisation; whereas the Chinese Government has encouraged the HKSAR
     Government to adopt a new zero-tolerance policy towards any mention of ‘self-
     determination’ or ‘independence’ on grounds of national security and in contravention
     of the Basic law;

K.   whereas mainland China’s judiciary lacks independence from the government and the
     Chinese Communist Party and is characterised by arbitrary detention, torture and other
     ill-treatment, serious violations of the right to a fair trial, enforced disappearances and
     various systems of incommunicado detention without trial;

L.   whereas a cross-party international coalition led by the former Governor of Hong Kong,
     Lord Patten, which has so far been joined by around 900 parliamentarians and
     policymakers from more than 40 countries, issued a statement decrying Beijing’s
     ‘unilateral introduction of national security legislation in Hong Kong,’ and calling for
     sympathetic governments to unite against this ‘flagrant breach of the Sino-British Joint
     Declaration’;

M.   whereas the Pan-Democracy Camp won an overwhelming victory in the Hong Kong
     district elections of 24 November 2019; whereas the Hong Kong Legislative Council
     elections are scheduled for September 2020;

N.   whereas UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab stated on 2 June 2020 in the House of
     Commons that if China follows through with its proposed legislation, the government
     will put in place new arrangements to allow British National Overseas passport holders
     in Hong Kong to come to the United Kingdom without the current six month limit,
     enabling them to live and apply to study and work for extendable periods of 12 months,
     thereby also providing a pathway to citizenship;

O.   whereas according to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU): ‘the Union’s
     action on the international scene shall be guided by the principles which have inspired
     its own creation, development and enlargement, and which it seeks to advance in the
     wider world’;

1.   Deplores the unilateral introduction of national security legislation by Beijing in Hong
     Kong, as this is a comprehensive assault on the city’s autonomy, rule of law, and
     fundamental freedoms; stresses that the integrity of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ is
     seriously threatened; stresses that the introduction of the planned national security
     legislation would be seen as a breach of the People’s Republic of China’s commitments
     and obligations under international law, in particular the Sino-British Joint Declaration,
     threatens to severely damage the relationship of trust between China and the EU, and

     affect future cooperation, as well as business confidence in Hong Kong as a major
     global financial centre;

2.   Strongly condemns the constant and increasing interference by China in Hong Kong’s
     internal affairs, as well the recent assertion by China that the Sino-British Joint
     Declaration of 1984 is a historic document, and hence no longer valid; stresses that the
     Chinese Government is bound by the Joint Declaration, which was registered with the
     UN as a legally binding treaty, to uphold Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and its
     rights and freedoms; expresses deep concern that a permanent infringement of Hong
     Kong’s autonomous governing framework will severely dampen its economy; calls
     upon the PRC Central Government to desist from pressuring the business community
     into supporting the National Security legislation, and to refrain from labelling
     international support for Hong Kong’s autonomy and Hong Kong’s freedoms as
     ‘interference in internal affairs’ and acts of subversion and separation, as these concerns
     address binding international obligations of the PRC;

3.   Calls on the Chinese authorities to respect China’s international obligations under the
     Sino-British Joint Declaration; stresses that China should fully respect the Basic Law
     and the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle, including by finally implementing
     universal suffrage; underlines that China should not undermine the high degree of
     autonomy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;

4.   Supports the VP/HR’s assessment that a new and more robust strategy to deal with a
     more assertive China is necessary, as well as an open and honest dialogue; urges the
     Council and the EEAS to adopt a stronger position supporting Hong Kong’s continued
     legal autonomy; stresses that this is paramount to let pro-democracy supporters in Hong
     Kong and the wider international community know that the EU will stand by its
     founding values of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law;

5.   Strongly urges the Council and the VP/HR to ensure that all aspects of EU relations
     with the People’s Republic of China are guided by principles and values stipulated in
     Article 21 of the TEU, and to address the issue of the national security law for Hong
     Kong as a top priority on the agenda of the upcoming EU-China Summit and at the
     planned EU-China Leaders meeting, as well as other human rights issues, such as the
     situation of the Uyghurs;

6.   Stresses that the EU is China’s largest export destination; believes that the EU should
     use its economic leverage to challenge China’s crackdown on human rights by
     economic means; underlines that the current situation reinforces Parliament’s conviction
     that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms must be an important element
     in the negotiations of an EU-China investment agreement; calls on the Commission to
     make use of all means at its disposal, together with the ongoing negotiations for a
     bilateral investment agreement, to put pressure on the Chinese authorities to preserve
     Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy as well as the basic rights and freedoms of its
     citizens and independent civil society organisations and to improve the human rights
     situation in the mainland and in Hong Kong; reiterates its call to include a binding and
     enforceable sustainable development chapter in the agreement; urges the EU, pursuant
     to Article 21 of the TEU, to include a human rights clause in any future trade agreement
     with the People’s Republic of China; instructs the Commission to inform the Chinese
     side that Parliament will take the human rights situation in China, including in Hong

       Kong, into consideration when asked to endorse a comprehensive agreement on
       investment or future trade deals with the PRC;

7.     Stresses that the international community must work together closely to put pressure on
       Beijing to ensure that its actions are in line with the country’s international
       commitments under the 1984 Sino-British Declaration;

8.     Observes that the PRC’s policy of abandoning the ‘One Country, Two Systems’
       approach has greatly alienated the people of Taiwan, and emphasises its willingness to
       cooperate with international partners in order to help strengthening democracy in
       Taiwan;

9.     Calls on the EU and its Member States to consider, in the event the new security law is
       applied, filing a case before the International Court of Justice alleging that China’s
       decision to impose national security legislation on Hong Kong violates the Sino-British
       Joint Declaration and the ICCPR;

10.    Urges the EU Member States that are members of the UN Security Council to convene
       an ‘Arria meeting’ to discuss the situation in Hong Kong with activists, NGO
       representatives and UN Special Rapporteurs; calls, in this context, on the EU to push for
       the UN Secretary General or the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to appoint a
       UN Special Envoy or Special Rapporteur on the situation in Hong Kong, joining the
       initiative by the Chairs of the UK, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand Foreign
       Affairs Committees;

11.    Calls on the Council and the VP/HR to work with the international community to
       establish an international contact group on Hong Kong, and to coordinate action with
       international partners, in particular with the United Kingdom;

12.    Calls on the Council and in particular on the incoming Council Presidency to finalise in
       2020 the work on an EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Mechanism as supported by
       the European Parliament in its resolution of 14 March 20191, and calls on the Council to
       adopt targeted sanctions and assets freezes against Chinese officials responsible for
       devising and implementing policies that violate human rights; believes this human
       rights framework could be used to impose Magnitsky-style sanctions on the leaders who
       conduct this crackdown on Hong Kong and its people and are responsible for serious
       human rights abuses; stresses that such sanctions should be discussed and, when
       possible coordinated with democratic partners such as Australia, Canada, the USA,
       Japan and South Korea;

13.    Calls for the EU, its Member States and the international community to work towards
       the imposition of appropriate export control mechanisms including cyber surveillance
       items to deny China, and in particular Hong Kong, access to technologies used to
       violate basic rights; calls on the co-legislators, in this regard, to conclude a common
       position on reform of the Dual Use Regulation; stresses that Parliament has further
       developed and strengthened the Commission’s proposal on the inclusion of strict export
       controls for listed and non-listed cyber-surveillance technology;

      particular technological dependency on the PRC, including in EU Member State
      decisions on developing their 5G networks;

      scheme for the citizens of Hong Kong in the case of any further deterioration of human
      rights and fundamental freedoms;

      rights violations and political intimidation; expresses grave concern over the reported
      practices of secret detention, of torture and ill-treatment, and of forced confessions;
      calls on the EU Member States to fully apply the relevant EU human rights guidelines,
      mobilising all diplomatic personnel to resolutely react to arrests and convictions of
      activists, including by ensuring trial observation, requesting prison visits, reaching out
      to relevant authorities to urge the release of those detained and convicted for the
      peaceful exercise of their freedom of expression;

17.   Calls for an independent, impartial, effective and prompt investigation into the use of
      force by Hong Kong police against protesters; calls on the authorities of the Hong Kong
      Special Administrative Region to ensure that the charges against the 15 pro-democracy
      activists and politicians, as well as peaceful demonstrators, are dropped and the
      prosecution is stopped, including, among others, Martin Lee, Margaret Ng, Lee Cheuk-
      yan, Benny Tai, Jimmy Lai, Albert Ho and Leung Kwok-hung;

18.   Expresses great concern at the steady deterioration of civil rights, political rights and
      press freedom; is deeply concerned by the abrogation of journalists’ rights, the

      in particular, to coverage of sensitive issues on mainland China or those concerning the
      HKSAR Government;

19.   Expresses growing concern over the heightened risk of the entry into force of the
      National Security Law for hundreds of thousands of EU citizens in Hong Kong;

20.   Urges the VP/HR and the Member States’ delegations to monitor closely and report
      regularly on the run-up to the Legislative Council (LegCo) elections currently scheduled
      for September, taking particular note of whether candidates are unjustly barred from
      running either through procedural obstacles or baseless legal proceedings, taking note
      also of whether all have access to assemble for campaign purposes, and whether voters
      are able to cast their votes freely; calls upon the HKSAR Government to ensure free and
      fair elections to the Legislative Council in September 2020; urges China to refrain from
      interference in the election processes in the HKSAR; reiterates its call for a systematic
      reform to implement direct elections for the position of Chief Executive and to the
      Legislative Council, as enshrined in the Basic Law, and calls for agreement on an
      electoral system that is overall democratic, fair, open and transparent and that grants the
      people of the HKSAR the right to elect candidates, and to stand for election in the
      selection process for all leadership positions;

21.   Calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai

      and to ensure a dialogue with the governments of the HKSAR and of China; recalls the
      importance for the EU to raise the issue of human rights violations in China, in
      particular the case of minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, at every political and human
      rights dialogue with the Chinese authorities, in line with the EU’s commitment to
      project a strong, clear and unified voice in its approach to the country; recalls, further,
      that in its ongoing reform process and increasing global engagement, China has opted
      into the international human rights framework by signing up to a wide range of
      international human rights treaties; calls for the dialogue with China to be pursued to
      ensure that it lives up to these commitments;

23.   Pays respect to the brave people of China who gathered in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square
      in June 1989 to call for the elimination of corruption, for political reforms and civil

      Administrative Region.

     which upholds the rights of minority nationalities,

–    having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of

–    having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948,

–    having regard to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights of 2011,

–    having regard to the concluding observations of the report on China by the UN
     Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,

–    having regard to Rule 132(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
     should remain at the centre of the EU’s policy towards China, in line with the EU’s
     commitment to uphold these very same values in its external action and China’s
     commitment to adhere to them in its own development and international cooperation;

B.   whereas since President Xi Jinping assumed power in March 2013, the human rights
     situation in China has continued to deteriorate; whereas the Chinese Government has
     increased its hostility towards peaceful dissent, the freedoms of expression and religion,
     and the rule of law; whereas the Chinese authorities have detained and prosecuted
     hundreds of human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists;

C.   whereas the situation in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where more than
     10 million Muslim Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs live, has rapidly deteriorated in the last
     few years, not least since the launch of the ‘Strike Hard against Violent Terrorism’
     campaign in 2014, as control of Xinjiang has been made a top priority of the Chinese
     authorities, fuelled by instability and security threats that Uyghurs are allegedly posing
     to Xinjiang and the strategic location of Xinjiang as a core region for the Belt and Road
     Initiative (BRI), with ambitious future production targets for textiles and other labour-

1    Texts adopted, P8_TA(2019)0215.

     intensive manufacturing products; whereas the Chinese Government’s war on terror in
     Xinjiang is increasingly turning into a war on religion and ethnicity; whereas there is
     information suggesting that the Xinjiang camp system has been expanded into other
     parts of China;

D.   whereas the Chinese authorities are conducting an increasingly intense campaign of
     mass internment, intrusive digital surveillance (including facial recognition technology
     and data collection), political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation; whereas,
     moreover, there is reliable information to suggest that Uyghurs and other primarily
     Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have been
     subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, egregious restrictions on religious practice and
     culture, and a digitised surveillance system so pervasive that every aspect of daily life is
     monitored – through facial recognition cameras, mobile phone scans, DNA collection,
     and an extensive and intrusive police presence;

E.   whereas numerous credible estimates put at as high as around one million the number of
     people that are or have been arbitrarily detained in what are being called ‘political re-
     education’ centres for undetermined periods of time on the pretext of countering
     terrorism and religious extremism; whereas these re-education facilities are also referred
     to as ‘vocational training centres’; whereas this represents the largest mass incarceration
     of an ethnic minority population in the world today; whereas according to some former
     detainees, treatment and conditions in these camps include crowded and unsanitary
     conditions, food deprivation, beatings and sexual abuse; whereas there are reports that
     young children have been sent to state-run orphanages if even one of their parents is
     detained in the internment camps; whereas some re-education camps reportedly contain
     factories producing goods for export;

F.   whereas the China Cables revelations, which were released in November 2019, are an
     investigation into the surveillance and mass internment without charge or trial of
     Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in China’s Xinjiang province, based on leaked
     classified Chinese Government documents; whereas the secret documents came to the
     International Consortium of Investigative Journalists via a chain of exiled Uyghurs and
     their authenticity has been confirmed by several leading experts; whereas the
     publication of these documents has also unearthed classified Chinese Government
     information revealing the inner workings of the camps, the severity of conditions behind
     the fences, and the dehumanising regime regulating inmates’ daily routines; whereas the
     documents bring to light China’s systematic brainwashing of hundreds of thousands of
     Muslims in a network of high-security prison camps and the mechanics of Xinjiang’s
     system of mass surveillance and predictive policing, thus confirming the findings of
     experts based on satellite imagery, data and eyewitness accounts that were published in
     recent years; whereas the Chinese Government has consistently claimed that the camps
     offer voluntary education and training; whereas the China Cables show unprecedented
     evidence that the groundwork for the repressive measures against Uyghurs, Kazakhs
     and others was being prepared at the highest political level since as long ago as April
     2014;

G.   whereas the detention and persecution of Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in
     Xinjiang has compelled many to stop communicating with their family and friends
     based abroad, including in Europe, for fear of retribution by the authorities;

H.   whereas repression has intensified since the entry into force of the regulations on
     religious affairs in February 2018, which have restricted the activities of religious

     groups and forced them to act more closely in line with party policies; whereas under
     those regulations, public or even private demonstrations of religious and cultural
     affiliation can be considered extremist; whereas the new rules threaten persons
     associated with religious communities that do not have legal status in the country;
     whereas religious communities have been facing increasing repression in China, making
     the country home to one of the largest populations of religious prisoners;

I.   whereas in August 2018, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial
     Discrimination challenged the Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
     over abuses in Xinjiang, including the establishment of mass arbitrary detention camps;
     whereas in September 2018, during her first ever speech in the role, the UN High
     Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet noted the ‘deeply disturbing
     allegations of large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uyghurs and other Muslim
     communities, in so-called re-education camps across Xinjiang’; whereas the Chinese
     Government has refused numerous requests from the UN Working Group on Enforced
     or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID), the UN High Commissioner for Human
     Rights and other UN Special Procedures mandates to send independent investigators to
     Xinjiang and give them access to the camps;

J.   whereas the internment camps in Xinjiang expanded rapidly after the appointment of
     Chen Quanguo as party leader for the region in August 2016; whereas the Governor of
     Xinjiang, Shohrat Zakir, claimed in December 2019 that all 1.5 million people in re-
     education and internment camps had been ‘returned to society’ without providing any
     proof;

K.   whereas some Chinese minority communities residing in the EU have been harassed by
     the Chinese authorities; whereas Uyghurs overseas have been pressured to return to
     China; whereas the China Cables documents detail explicit directives to arrest Uyghurs
     with foreign citizenship and to track down Xinjiang Uyghurs living abroad, some of
     whom have been deported back to China by authoritarian governments; whereas the
     documents indicate that Chinese embassies have been instrumental in this practice;

L.   whereas on 4 December 2019 the US Congress adopted the Uyghurs Human Rights
     Policy Act, which urges the Secretary of State to take immediate measures to protect
     human rights and to consider imposing visa and economic sanctions, pursuant to the
     Global Magnitsky Act, on PRC officials responsible for human rights abuses in
     Xinjiang province, while protecting Uyghurs residing in the USA from Chinese
     harassment and persecution;

M.   whereas the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2019 was awarded to Uyghur
     economics professor Ilham Tohti, who was sentenced to life imprisonment on
     23 September 2014 for alleged separatism, after being detained in January of the same
     year; whereas seven of his former students were also detained and sentenced to
     imprisonment of between three and eight years for alleged collaboration with Mr Tohti;
     whereas Ilham Tohti has always rejected separatism and violence, and has sought
     reconciliation based on respect for Uyghur culture;

N.   whereas in its Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy, the EU pledged
     to step up its efforts to promote human rights, democracy and the rule of law across all
     aspects of its external action, and to place human rights at the centre of its relations with
     all third countries, including its strategic partners;

1.   Expresses its deepest concerns about the increasingly repressive regime that Uyghurs
     and other Muslim ethnic minorities are facing and demands that the authorities respect
     their fundamental freedoms, as recommended by credible reports; strongly condemns
     the sending of hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs to political ‘re-
     education camps’ on the basis of a system of predictive policing, including for having
     travelled abroad or being adjudged too religiously devout; calls on the Chinese
     authorities in Xinjiang to provide information about the locations and medical
     conditions of those detained; urges the Chinese Government to put an immediate end to
     the practice of arbitrary detention without charge, trial or conviction for a criminal
     offence of members of the Uyghur and Kazakh minorities, to close all camps and
     detention centres, and to immediately and unconditionally release those detained;
     emphasises that any kind of detention, when applied in violation of fundamental
     international laws, that persecution against specific persons or groups on ethnic, cultural
     or religious grounds, and that other inhumane acts causing great suffering or serious
     injury, when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on any civilian
     population, are unacceptable in the light of the international legal framework;

2.   Calls on the Chinese authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the Uyghur
     scholar Ilham Tohti and all other human rights defenders, activists, lawyers, journalists
     and petitioners detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their freedom of expression,
     and to end the ongoing crackdown involving detention, judicial harassment and
     intimidation; calls on the Chinese Government to ensure that they have regular,
     unrestricted access to their families and lawyers of their choice, and to ensure that they,
     their families and their lawyers are not subjected to torture or other ill-treatment; insists
     that the conditions of all those in detention must meet the standards laid down in the
     Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or
     Imprisonment adopted by UN General Assembly resolution 43/173 of 9 December
     1988, including access to medical care; calls for an immediate, effective and impartial
     investigation into the alleged torture of Ilham Tohti and for those responsible to be
     brought to justice;

3.   Reiterates its call on the Chinese authorities to allow free, meaningful and unhindered
     access to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region for independent journalists and
     international observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and
     the mandate holders of the UN Human Rights Council Special Procedures; notes the
     imbalance in press access and freedom between the EU and China; calls on China to
     provide EU media outlets with the same rights and access that Chinese media outlets are
     afforded in the Member States; believes that the EU and the Member States should take
     the lead during the next session of the UN Human Rights Council on a resolution
     establishing a fact-finding mission to Xinjiang;

4.   Expresses deep concern over reports concerning the harassment of Uyghurs abroad by
     the Chinese authorities in order to force them to act as informants against other
     Uyghurs, return to Xinjiang or remain silent about the situation there, sometimes by
     detaining their family members; urges the Commission and all Member States to
     investigate these reports as a matter of urgency, to take specific measures to ensure that
     members of the Xinjiang diaspora are protected in their respective countries, and to
     expedite asylum requests from Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims; welcomes the
     decision taken by some Member States to suspend the return of all ethnic Uyghurs,
     Kazakhs or other Turkic Muslims to China in view of the risk of arbitrary detention,
     torture or other ill-treatment, and calls on all other Member States to follow suit;

5.    Notes with concern that the critical importance of ‘long-term stability’ in Xinjiang to
      the success of the BRI has led to the intensification of long-standing control strategies
      bolstered by a variety of technological innovations and a rapid increase in spending on
      domestic security, and the use of counter-terrorism measures to criminalise dissent and
      dissident individuals by applying a broad definition of ‘terrorism’; expresses deep
      concern at the Chinese State’s measures to ensure the ‘comprehensive supervision’ of
      Xinjiang through the installation of Skynet electronic surveillance in major urban areas
      and GPS trackers in all motor vehicles, the use of facial recognition scanners at
      checkpoints and train and petrol stations, and the blood collection campaign by Xinjiang
      police in order to further expand China’s DNA database; express further concerns that
      China is exporting such technologies to authoritarian regimes around the world;

6.    Expresses deep concern over reports of the possible use of forced labour drawn from
      internment camps in the supply chain of international companies doing business in
      Xinjiang and over reports of collaboration with the Chinese institutions involved in the
      mass surveillance or detention of members of the Uyghur population; emphasises that
      actors from the private sector should assess their engagement in Xinjiang in order to
      scrutinise their supply chains to ensure they are not involved in human rights violations,
      including by putting in place a robust human rights due diligence system to make sure
      they are not implicated in forced labour or complicit in acts of repression against the
      Uyghur people; stresses that if products are produced in re-education camps they should
      be banned from EU markets;

7.    Urges the Chinese Government to immediately publish a list of all those in detention
      and all those who have been released, and to release the full details of persons
      disappeared in Xinjiang to their families;

8.    Urges the Commission, the Council and the Member States to take all the necessary
      measures to persuade the Chinese Government to close the camps, to end all human
      rights violations in Xinjiang, and to uphold the linguistic, cultural, religious and other
      fundamental freedoms of the Uyghurs; Urges the Vice President of the
      Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy
      (VP/HR), the EEAS and the Member States to more intensively monitor the worrying
      human rights developments in Xinjiang, including increased government repression and
      surveillance, and to speak out against violations of human rights in China both privately
      and publicly and at the highest levels; expresses its disappointment at the fact that the
      37th round of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue brought no substantial results,
      despite the EU raising the system of political re-education camps as a worrying
      development; regrets the fact that the approach taken and tools used by the EU so far
      have not yielded tangible progress in China’s human rights record, which has only
      deteriorated over the last decade; calls on the VP/HR to insist on an independent
      investigation into the scale and nature of the internment camp system and the numerous
      allegations of serious and systematic human rights violations; urges the new
      Commission to devise and implement a holistic EU strategy with a view to securing
      genuine progress on human rights in China;

9.    Underlines the fact that in their joint statement issued after the 21st EU-China summit,
      the EU and China reaffirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible,
      interdependent and interrelated; emphasises that the promotion of human rights and the
      rule of law must be at the core of the EU’s engagement with China;

10.   Calls for the EU, its Member States and the international community to consider ways

      of halting all exports and technology transfers of goods and services that are being used
      by China to extend and improve its cyber surveillance, by making effective use of
      appropriate export control mechanisms; calls on the co-legislators, in this regard, to
      conclude a common position on reform of the Dual Use Regulation on the grounds of
      national security and human rights considerations; stresses that Parliament has further
      developed and strengthened the Commission’s proposal on the inclusion of strict export
      controls for listed and non-listed cyber-surveillance technology;

11.   Recalls the importance of the EU continuing to raise the issue of human rights
      violations in China, and in particular the case of minorities in Xinjiang, at every
      political and human rights dialogue with the Chinese authorities, in line with the EU’s
      commitment to project a strong, clear and unified voice in its approach to the country;
      reiterates that in its ongoing reform process and increasing global engagement, China
      has opted into the international human rights framework by signing up to a wide range
      of international human rights treaties; calls, therefore, for the establishment of a
      dialogue with China so as to encourage it to live up to these commitments; urges the
      Chinese authorities to continue to implement the national reforms required to ratify the
      1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was signed by China
      in 1998, and to implement the recommendations of UN human rights bodies;

12.   Welcomes the adoption by the US Congress of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act
      and the recent decision by the Foreign Affairs Council to start working on an EU global
      sanctions regime for human rights violations; calls on the Council to adopt targeted
      sanctions and assets freezes, should they be deemed appropriate and effective, against
      the Chinese officials responsible for devising and implementing the policy of mass
      detention of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang and for orchestrating a
      severe repression of religious freedom, freedom of movement and other basic rights in
      the region;

      belief;

– having regard to the United Nations’ universal periodic review (UPR) of China carried out
  in November 2018,

– having regard to Rules 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
   should remain at the centre of the long-standing relationship between the EU and China,
   in line with the EU’s commitment to uphold these values in its external action and China’s
   expressed interest in adhering to these very values in its own development and
   international cooperation;

B. whereas the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has
   proposed the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters
   Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 to amend the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (FOO)
   and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance (MLAO);

C. whereas Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam announced on 9 July 2019 that the widely
   loathed legislation was ‘dead’; whereas she stopped short of announcing that the bill
   would be withdrawn;

D. whereas the proposed bill could facilitate the rendition to China of people for political
   reasons and their exposure to a judicial system with serious human rights failings; whereas
   under the proposed amendments, the Hong Kong court would not have the clear, explicit
   jurisdiction and legal obligation to examine the various human rights involved in cases
   being handled by the courts in mainland China or in other countries;

E. whereas mainland China’s judiciary lacks independence from the government and the
   Chinese Communist Party and is characterised by arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-
   treatment, serious violations of the right to a fair trial, enforced disappearances and
   various systems of incommunicado detention without trial;

F. whereas many citizens of Hong Kong, from pro-democracy activists to business people,
   fear being extradited to mainland China;

G. whereas the people of Hong Kong have taken to the streets in unprecedented numbers,
   peacefully exercising their fundamental right to assemble and to protest; whereas on 12
   June 2019, tens of thousands of protesters assembled around the Legislative Council
   building and its nearby roads, calling on the government to drop its proposed amendments
   to Hong Kong’s extradition law;

H. whereas more than 70 human rights NGOs, including, Amnesty International, Human
   Rights Watch, Human Rights Monitor, the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law
   Society of Hong Kong, had addressed a collective letter to Chief Executive Lam,
   requesting that her government drop the extradition bill as it posed a threat to respect for
   human rights;

I. whereas the Hong Kong police used the violent acts of a small number of protesters as a
   pretext to use unnecessary and excessive force against the peaceful vast majority,
   including tear gas, rubber bullets, beanbags and pepper spray, labelled the incident a riot
   and hence proceeded to make several dozen arrests; whereas several people were charged
   with rioting, which carries a 10-year prison sentence;

J. whereas, over the years, the people of Hong Kong have witnessed mass demonstrations in
   favour of democracy and the full implementation of the Basic Law, such as the 2014
   protests by the so-called Umbrella Movement, as well as demonstrations in favour of
   media freedoms and, among other things, against the disappearance of the Hong Kong
   booksellers;

K. whereas at the end of 2015, four Hong Kong residents, among them Gui Minhai, and one
   non-resident associated with the publishing house Mighty Current and its bookshop,
   disappeared; whereas months later, information emerged that they were being detained in
   mainland China in undisclosed locations; whereas one of the booksellers who returned to
   Hong Kong has since moved to Taiwan out of fear of being extradited;

L. whereas the Basic Law lays down provisions guaranteeing protection for human rights
   and individual freedoms; whereas Article 27 of the Basic Law guarantees freedom of
   speech, of the press and publication, and of association, assembly, procession and
   demonstration; whereas Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law stipulate that the Chief
   Executive and all members of the Legislative Council should ultimately be elected by
   universal suffrage;

M. whereas the EU supports the ‘one country, two systems’ principle and Hong Kong’s high
   degree of autonomy;

1. Calls on the HKSAR Government to withdraw the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal
   Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019;

2. Calls on the HKSAR Government to immediately release and drop all charges against
   peaceful protesters and all those detained for the peaceful exercise of their freedom of
   expression during or in the lead-up to protests;

3. Calls for an independent, impartial, effective and prompt investigation into the use of
   force by Hong Kong police against protesters;

4. Stresses that the EU shares many of the concerns raised by citizens of Hong Kong
   regarding the proposed extradition reforms and has conveyed them to the HKSAR
   Government; underlines that the bill has far-reaching consequences for Hong Kong and its
   people, for the EU and for foreign citizens, as well as for business confidence in Hong
   Kong;

5. Urges Hong Kong to ensure that its legislation remains fully in line with its international
   human rights obligations, including provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and
   Political Rights (ICCPR) and of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
   Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;

6. Recognises that the people of Hong Kong have taken to the streets in extraordinary
   numbers in recent weeks, with estimates of more than a million people on 9 June 2019 and

   up to two million the following week, in mainly peaceful mass demonstrations triggered
   by high levels of concern regarding the proposed laws on extradition;

7. Underlines that the rights of Hong Kong citizens have generally been upheld in Hong
   Kong, but expresses great concern at the steady deterioration of civil rights, political rights
   and press freedom; is deeply concerned by the unprecedented pressure on journalists and
   their increasing self-censorship with regard, in particular, to coverage of sensitive issues
   on mainland China or those concerning the HKSAR Government;

8. Stresses that the Basic Law guarantees freedom of speech, of the press and publication,
   and of association, assembly, procession and demonstration; calls on the authorities in
   Hong Kong and China to ensure the protection of human rights and the freedoms
   enshrined in the Basic Law for all citizens;

9. Strongly condemns the constant and increasing interference by China in Hong Kong’s
   internal affairs, as well the recent assertion by China that the Sino-British Joint
   Declaration of 1984 is a historic document, and hence is no longer valid; stresses that the
   Chinese Government is bound by the Joint Declaration to uphold Hong Kong’s high
   degree of autonomy and its rights and freedoms;

10. Notes with deep concern in this context that opposition candidates, including Anges Chow
    and former lawmaker Lau Siu-Lai, were not allowed to run in the Legislative Council by-
    election owing to their political affiliation or views;

11. Calls for the EU, its Member States and the international community to work towards the
    imposition of appropriate export control mechanisms to deny China, and in particular
    Hong Kong, access to technologies used to violate basic rights;

12. Urges systematic reform to implement direct elections for the position of Chief Executive
    and to the Legislative Council, as enshrined in the Basic Law, and calls for agreement on
    an electoral system that is overall democratic, fair, open and transparent and that it grants
    the people of the HKSAR the right to elect candidates and to stand for election in the
    selection process for all leadership positions;

13. Repeats its call for the immediate release of book publisher Gui Minhai, a Swedish
    national;

14. Underlines the EU’s commitment to strengthening democracy, including the rule of law,
    the independence of the judiciary, fundamental freedoms and rights, transparency, and
    freedom of information and expression in Hong Kong;

15. Recalls the importance of the EU continuing to raise the issue of human rights violations
    in China at every political and human rights dialogue with the Chinese authorities, in line
    with the EU’s commitment to project a strong, clear and unified voice in its approach to
    the country; further recalls that in its ongoing reform process and increasing global
    engagement, China has opted into the international human rights framework by signing up
    to a wide range of international human rights treaties; calls for the EU, therefore, to pursue
    dialogue with China in order to ensure that it lives up to these commitments;

16. Calls on the VP/HR, the EEAS and the Member States to raise all these concerns and to
    ensure a dialogue with the governments of the HKSAR and of China;

17. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Vice-
    President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and
    Security Policy, the Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of China, and
    the Chief Executive and the Assembly of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

China, notably the situation of religious and ethnic minorities
European Parliament resolution of 18 April 2019 on China, notably the situation of
religious and ethnic minorities (2019/2690(RSP))

The European Parliament,

–    having regard to its previous resolutions on the situation in China, in particular those of
     26 November 2009 on China: minority rights and application of the death penalty1, of
     10 March 2011 on the situation and cultural heritage in Kashgar (Xinjiang Uyghur
     Autonomous Region)2, of 15 December 2016 on the cases of the Larung Gar Tibetan
     Buddhist Academy and Ilham Tohti3, of 12 September 2018 on the state of EU-China
     relations4 and of 4 October 2018 on mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and Kazakhs in
     the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region5,

–    having regard to the EU-China Strategic Partnership launched in 2003 and to the joint
     communication from the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for
     Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of 22 June 2016 entitled ‘Elements for a new EU
     strategy on China’(JOIN(2016)0030),

–    having regard to the EU guidelines on the promotion and protection of freedom of
     religion or belief, adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 24 June 2013,

–    having regard to the joint communication from the Commission and the High
     Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of 12 March 2019
     entitled ‘EU-China – A strategic outlook’(JOIN(2019)0005),

–    having regard to the ‘Joint statement of the 21st EU-China summit’ of 9 April 2019,

–    having regard to the EU-China dialogue on human rights, launched in 1995, and the
     37th round thereof, held in Brussels on 1 and 2 April 2019,

–    having regard to Article 36 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, which

1    OJ C 285 E, 21.10.2010, p. 80.
2    OJ C 199 E, 7.7.2012, p. 185.

4    Texts adopted, P8_TA(2018)0343.
5    Texts adopted, P8_TA(2018)0377.

     guarantees all citizens the right to freedom of religious belief, and to Article 4 thereof,
     which upholds the rights of ‘minority nationalities’,

–    having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 16
     December 1966, signed by China in 1998, but not ratified,

–    having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948,

–    having regard to the concluding observations of the UN Committee on the Elimination
     of Racial Discrimination’s review of China,

–    having regard to Rules 135(5) and 123(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas in its strategic framework on human rights and democracy, the EU pledges that
     human rights, democracy, and the rule of law will be promoted ‘in all areas of the EU’s
     external actions without exception’, and that the EU will ‘place human rights at the
     centre of its relations with all third countries including strategic partners’; whereas this
     should remain at the centre of the long-standing relationship between the EU and China,
     in accordance with the EU’s commitment to uphold these very same values in its
     external action and China’s expressed interest in respecting international laws and
     standards relating to human rights in its own development;

B.   whereas China has been successful in lifting 700 million people out of poverty, but
     whereas since President Xi Jinping assumed power in March 2013, the human rights
     situation in China has continued to deteriorate, with the government stepping up its
     hostility towards peaceful dissent, the freedoms of expression and religion, and the rule
     of law; whereas the Chinese authorities have detained and prosecuted hundreds of
     human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists;

C.   whereas the new regulations on religious affairs that took effect on 1 February 2018 are
     more restrictive towards religious groups and activities, and force them to fall more
     closely into line with party policies; whereas freedom of religion and conscience has
     reached a new low point since the start of the economic reforms and the opening up of
     China in the late 1970s; whereas China is home to one of the largest populations of
     religious prisoners;

D.   whereas, while an accord was reached between the Holy See and the Chinese
     Government in September 2018 concerning the appointments of bishops in China, the
     Christian religious communities have been facing increasing repression in China, with
     Christians, both in underground and government-approved churches, being targeted
     through the harassment and detention of believers, the demolition of churches, the
     confiscation of religious symbols and the crackdown on Christian gatherings; whereas
     Chinese authorities in some provinces do not allow persons under 18 years of age to
     attend religious activities; whereas in September 2018 China banned the Zion Church,
     the biggest house congregation in China with more than 1 500 followers;

E.   whereas the situation in Xinjiang, where 10 million Muslim Uyghurs and ethnic
     Kazakhs live, has rapidly deteriorated, as stability and the control of Xinjiang has been
     elevated to a top priority of the Chinese authorities, driven by both periodic terrorist
     attacks in, or allegedly connected to, Xinjiang by Uyghurs and the strategic location of
     the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region for the Belt and Road Initiative; whereas

     there is information that the Xinjiang camp system has expanded into other parts of
     China;

F.   whereas an extrajudicial detention programme has been established, holding ‘from tens
     of thousands to upwards of a million Uyghurs’ who are being forced to undergo
     political ‘re-education’ according to estimates cited by the UN Committee on the
     Elimination of Racial Discrimination, without being charged or tried, for undetermined
     periods of time, and are therefore being arbitrarily detained under the pretext of
     countering terrorism and religious extremism; whereas a policy of strict restrictions on
     religious practices and the Uyghur language and customs has been developed in the
     Xinjiang province;

G.   whereas a sophisticated network of invasive digital surveillance has been developed,
     including facial recognition technology and data collection;

H.   whereas the Chinese Government has refused numerous requests from the UN Working
     Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID), the UN High
     Commissioner for Human Rights and other UN Special Procedures mandates to send
     independent investigators to Xinjiang;

I.   whereas the situation in Tibet has deteriorated over the past few years, in spite of
     economic growth and infrastructure development, with the Chinese Government
     curtailing a wide range of human rights under the pretext of security and stability, and
     engaging in relentless attacks against Tibetan identity and culture;

J.   whereas the surveillance and control measures in Tibet have been on the increase over
     the past few years, as well as arbitrary detentions, acts of torture and ill-treatment;
     whereas the Chinese Government has created an environment in Tibet in which there
     are no limits to state authority, the climate of fear is pervasive, and every aspect of
     public and private life is tightly controlled and regulated; whereas in Tibet, any acts of
     non-violent dissent or criticism of state policies with regard to ethnic or religious
     minorities can be considered as ‘splittist’ and therefore criminalised; whereas access to
     the Tibet Autonomous Region today is more restricted than ever before;

K.   whereas an extremely high number of Tibetans, mostly monks and nuns, have
     reportedly set themselves on fire since 2009 in protest against restrictive Chinese
     policies in Tibet, and in support of the return of the Dalai Lama and the right to
     religious freedom in the Aba/Ngaba county prefecture in Sichuan Province and other
     parts of the Tibetan plateau; whereas no progress has been made in the resolution of the
     Tibetan crisis in the last 10 years;

1.   Is deeply concerned about the increasingly repressive regime that many religious and
     ethnic minorities, in particular Uyghurs and Kazakhs, Tibetans and Christians face,
     placing additional restraints on the constitutional guarantees of their right to freedom of
     cultural expression and religious belief, to freedom of speech and expression and to
     peaceful assembly and association; demands that the authorities respect these
     fundamental freedoms;

2.   Calls on the Chinese Government to immediately end the practice of arbitrary
     detentions, without any charge, trial or conviction for criminal offence, of members of
     the Uyghur and Kazakh minority and Tibetans , to close all camps and detention centres

      and to release the detained persons immediately and unconditionally;

3.    Calls for the immediate release of arbitrarily detained people, prisoners of conscience,
      including practitioners of Falun Gong and for a stop to be put to enforced
      disappearances, and insists that all individuals are able to choose their legal
      representative, have access to their family and to medical assistance, as well as have
      their cases investigated;

4.    Calls on the Chinese Government to immediately release: Uyghurs, including Ilham
      Tohti, Tashpolat Tiyip, Rahile Dawut, Eli Mamut, Hailaite Niyazi, Memetjan Abdulla,
      Abduhelil Zunun, and Abdukerim Abduweli; individuals persecuted for their religious
      beliefs, including Zhang Shaojie, Hu Shigen, Wang Yi, and Sun Qian; Tibetan activists,
      writers and religious figures who face criminal charges or have been imprisoned for
      exercising their right to freedom of expression, including Tashi Wangchuk and Lobsang
      Dargye;

5.    Calls for the immediate release of the Swedish national book publisher Gui Minhai and
      the two Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig;

6.    Urges the Chinese Government to release the full details of persons disappeared in
      Xinjiang to their families;

7.    Calls on the Chinese authorities to end their campaigns against Christian congregations
      and organisations and to stop the harassment and detention of Christian pastors and
      priests and the forced demolitions of churches;

8.    Calls on the Chinese authorities to uphold the linguistic, cultural, religious and other
      fundamental freedoms of Tibetans, and to refrain from settlement policies in favour of
      the Han people and to the disadvantage of the Tibetans, as well as from forcing Tibetan
      nomads to abandon their traditional lifestyle;

9.    Condemns the campaigns carried out via the ‘patriotic education’ approach, including
      measures to stage-manage Tibetan Buddhist monasteries; is concerned that China’s
      criminal law is being abused to persecute Tibetans and Buddhists, whose religious
      activities are equated with ‘separatism’; deplores the fact that the environment for
      practising Buddhism in Tibet has worsened significantly after the Tibetan protests of
      March 2008, with the Chinese Government adopting a more pervasive approach to
      ‘patriotic education’;

10.   Urges the Chinese authorities to implement the constitutionally guaranteed right to
      freedom of religious belief for all Chinese citizens;

11.   Recalls the importance of the EU and its Member States raising the issue of human
      rights violations at every political level with the Chinese authorities, in line with the
      EU’s commitment to project a strong, clear and unified voice in its approach to the
      country, including the annual Human Rights Dialogue, Strategic Dialogue, High-Level
      Economic Dialogue, and Summit, as well as the forthcoming Euro-Asia Summit;

12.   Underlines that while in their joint statement issued after the 21st EU-China Summit,
      the EU and China reaffirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible,
      interdependent and interrelated, the EU should urge China to act accordingly; deplores
      the fact that at the EU-China Summit of 9 April 2019 urgent human rights concerns

      once again played a marginal role; takes the view that if and when EU-China summit
      language is weak on human rights, the Council, the European External Action Service
      (EEAS) and the Commission should decline to include it at all and issue a separate
      communication on the topic with a meaningful assessment both of the situation and why
      stronger language could not be agreed;

13.   Calls on EU Member States to prevent any activities undertaken by the Chinese
      authorities in the EU’s territory to harass members of Turkic communities, Tibetans and
      other religious or ethnic groups in order to compel them to act as informants, to force
      their return to China or silence them;

14.   Calls on the Chinese authorities to allow free, meaningful and unhindered access to
      Xinjiang province and Tibet Autonomous Region for journalists and international
      observers, including for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN Special
      Procedures; calls for the EU and the Member States to take the lead during the next
      session of the UN Human Rights Council on a resolution establishing a fact-finding
      mission to Xinjiang;

15.   Calls on the Chinese Government to guarantee unfettered respect of citizens’ rights in
      the Chinese Constitution, with regard to Article 4, which protects national minorities;
      Article 35, which protects the freedoms of speech, the press, assembly, association,
      procession and demonstration; Article 36, which recognises the right to freedom of
      religious belief; and Article 41, which guarantees the right to criticise and make
      suggestions regarding any state organ or official;

16.   Urges China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;

17.   Urges China to give EU diplomats, journalists and citizens unfettered access to Tibet in
      reciprocity for the free and open access to the entire territories of the EU Member States
      that Chinese travellers enjoy; urges the EU institutions to take the issue of access to
      Tibet into serious consideration in the discussions on the EU-China visa facilitation
      agreement;

18.   Expresses its disappointment at the fact that the 37th round of the EU-China Human
      Rights Dialogue brought no substantial results; regrets, furthermore, that the Chinese
      delegation did not take part on 2 April in the continuation of the dialogue that provided
      for an exchange of views with civil society organisations;

19.   Urges the VP/HR, the EEAS and Member States to monitor the worrying human rights
      developments in Xinjiang more intensively, including increased government repression
      and surveillance, and to speak out against violations of human rights in China both
      privately and publicly;

20.   Calls on the Council to consider adopting targeted sanctions against officials
      responsible for the crackdown in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;

21.   Calls for the EU, its Member States and the international community to halt all exports
      and technology transfers of goods and services that are being used by China to extend
      and improve its cyber surveillance and predictive profiling apparatus; is deeply
      concerned that China is already exporting such technologies to authoritarian states
      around the world;

22.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Vice-President of the
      Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security
      Policy, the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member
      States, and the Government and the Parliament of the Peoples’ Republic of China.

–    having regard to the recent general allegation letter sent in May 2018 by the UN
     Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) to the Chinese
     Government, expressing concern about the continued deterioration of the situation and
     increase in the number of Uyghurs being arbitrarily detained,

–    having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 16
     December 1966,

–    having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948,

–    having regard to Rules 135(5) and 123(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas the promotion of and respect for universal human rights, democracy and the
     rule of law should remain at the centre of the long-standing relationship between the EU
     and China, in accordance with the EU’s commitment to uphold these very same values
     in its external action and China’s expressed interest in adhering to them in its own
     development and international cooperation;

B.   whereas since President Xi Jinping assumed power, the human rights situation in China
     has deteriorated further, with the government stepping up its hostility toward peaceful
     dissent, the freedoms of expression and religion, and the rule of law;

C.   whereas the situation in Xinjiang, which is home to around 11 million Uyghurs and
     ethnic Kazakhs, has rapidly deteriorated in recent years, as absolute control of Xinjiang
     has been elevated to a top priority, while further challenges are posed by periodic
     terrorist attacks in or allegedly connected to Xinjiang, by Uyghurs;

D.   whereas the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has cited
     estimates that ‘from tens of thousands to upwards of a million Uighurs’ may be being
     detained in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), without being charged
     or tried, under the pretext of countering terrorism and religious extremism; whereas this
     would represent the largest mass incarceration of an ethnic minority population in the
     world today;

E.   whereas the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China has also stated that
     there is solid information that Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other primarily Muslim ethnic
     minorities in the XUAR have been subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, egregious
     restrictions on religious practice and culture, and a digital surveillance system so
     pervasive that every aspect of daily life is monitored – through facial recognition
     cameras, mobile phone scans, DNA collection and an extensive and intrusive police
     presence;

F.   whereas detainees are reportedly being held in poor conditions, subjected to political
     indoctrination, including mandatory courses in patriotism, and forced to denounce their
     ethnic and religious identity; whereas there are recent reports of deaths in custody
     including suicides;

G.   whereas thousands of children have reportedly been separated from their parents, who
     are arbitrarily detained in internment camps, and are being held in overcrowded
     orphanages, even if only one of their parents is detained in a camp;

H.   whereas at the UN hearing of 13 August 2018 in Geneva, the Chinese delegation denied

     the accusations made by UN experts of having detained ethnic Uyghur Muslims in ‘re-
     education’ camps in the western region of Xinjiang; whereas comprehensive evidence
     exists of the construction and upgrading of these facilities;

I.   whereas some foreign journalists have been pressured into refraining from reporting on
     sensitive issues such as Uyghur human rights and the use of internment camps,
     including in some cases through the refusal to renew press credentials;

J.   whereas nowhere in the world is the population monitored as strictly as in the XUAR;
     whereas the provincial government has recruited tens of thousands of additional security
     personnel;

K.   whereas data is collected by an ‘integrated joint operations platform’ that also stores
     further data on the population, including consumer habits, banking activity, health status
     and the DNA profile of every single inhabitant of the XUAR; whereas Muslims in the
     region are required to have a spyware app on their mobile phones and failure to install
     the app is an offence;

L.   whereas first-hand testimony and credible academic research have indicated that there is
     intentional targeting of Uyghurs with ties to people abroad and of those with religious
     beliefs;

M.   whereas Uyghurs overseas have been pressured to return to China, often with the
     support of host states; whereas Chinese embassies abroad have refused to renew many
     Uyghur passports, leading to insecurity in terms of work and study;

N.   whereas requests from the WGEID and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,
     and other UN Special Procedures mandates to send independent investigators to
     Xinjiang have been routinely denied by the Chinese Government;

O.   whereas the Uyghur economics professor Ilham Tohti was sentenced to life
     imprisonment on 23 September 2014 on the charge of alleged separatism, after being
     detained in January of the same year; whereas seven of his former students were also
     detained and sentenced to imprisonment of between three and eight years for alleged
     collaboration with Mr Tohti; whereas Ilham Tohti has always rejected separatism and
     violence and has sought reconciliation based on respect for Uyghur culture;

1.   Is deeply concerned about the increasingly suppressive regime imposed on different
     minorities, in particular Uyghurs and Kazakhs, with additional restrictions being placed
     on the constitutional guarantees of their rights to freedom of cultural expression and
     religious belief, speech and expression, and peaceful assembly and association;
     demands that the authorities respect these fundamental freedoms;

2.   Calls on the Chinese Government to immediately end the mass arbitrary detention of
     members of the Uyghur and Kazakh minorities, to close all camps and detention centres
     and to release detained persons immediately and unconditionally; is deeply concerned
     by the numerous allegations of poor conditions, torture and deaths inside the camps;
     reminds the Chinese authorities that re-education facilities have no legal basis;

3.   Is alarmed by the reported deaths of Muhammad Salih Hajim, Abdulnehed Mehsum,
     Ayhan Memet and others, all elderly Uyghurs, academics and community leaders, in
     internment camps;

4.    Expresses its deep concern at the state’s implementation of measures to ensure the
      ‘comprehensive supervision’ of the region through the installation of China’s ‘Skynet’
      electronic surveillance system in major urban areas, the installation of GPS trackers in
      motor vehicles, the use of facial recognition scanners at checkpoints and at train and
      petrol stations, and the blood-collecting activities of Xinjiang’s police force to further
      expand China’s DNA database;

5.    Emphasises that government control and the compulsory mass collection of citizens’
      data primarily targets and affects Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities, in
      violation of the prohibition of discrimination under international law;

6.    Urges the Chinese Government to release to the families concerned the full details of
      those forcibly disappeared in Xinjiang, including their names, whereabouts and current
      status;

7.    Is deeply concerned about China’s Counterterrorism Law (2015) and the Regulation on
      De-Extremification, which have an overly broad definition of what constitutes a
      terrorist act; calls, therefore, on China to clearly differentiate between peaceful dissent
      and violent extremism;

8.    Reiterates its call on the Chinese Government to immediately and unconditionally
      release Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti and all others detained solely for the peaceful
      exercise of their freedom of expression and, pending their release, calls on China to
      ensure that they have regular, unrestricted access to their families and lawyers of their
      choice; calls, furthermore, for the release of Eli Mamut, Hailaite Niyazi, Memetjan
      Abdulla, Abduhelil Zunun and Abdukerim Abduweli, as requested by the EU during the
      36th round of the EU-China Human Rights dialogue held in Beijing on 9-10 July 2018;

9.    Urges the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for
      Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR), the European External Action Service
      (EEAS) and the Member States to monitor intensely the changing human rights
      developments in Xinjiang, including the increased government repression of Uyghurs,
      Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities, and to send a strong message to the highest level
      of the Chinese Government to end the grotesque human rights violations;

10.   Calls on the Chinese authorities to allow free, unhindered access for journalists and
      international observers to Xinjiang province;

11.   Recalls the importance for the EU and the Member States of raising the issue of human
      rights violations in Xinjiang with the Chinese authorities, including at leadership level,
      in line with the EU’s commitment to project a strong, clear and unified voice in its
      approach to the country, including at the yearly Human Rights Dialogue and the
      upcoming Euro-Asia Summit;

12.   Expresses its deep concern regarding the reports of harassment of Uyghurs abroad by
      the Chinese authorities aiming to compel them to act as informants against other
      Uyghurs, return to Xinjiang or remain silent about the situation there, sometimes by
      detaining their family members;

13.   Welcomes the decision taken by Germany and Sweden to suspend the return of all
      ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs or other Turkic Muslims to China in consideration of the risk

      of arbitrary detention, torture or other ill-treatment they would face in the country, and
      calls on all other Member States to follow suit and to expedite asylum claims by Turkic
      Muslims at risk of being forcibly returned to China; further calls on EU Member States
      to invoke domestic law, as appropriate, to investigate the Chinese Government’s
      intimidation of Turkic Muslim diaspora communities in Europe;

14.   Reminds China of its human rights obligations following its signing of a wide range of
      international human rights treaties and therefore recalls that China is expected to live up
      to these commitments;

15.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Vice-President of the
      Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security
      Policy, the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member
      States, and the Government and the Parliament of the People’s Republic of China.

     35th round thereof, held in Brussels on 22 and 23 June 2017,

–    having regard to the awarding of its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Wei
     Jingsheng and Hu Jia in 1996 and 2008 respectively,

–    having regard to the statement by the Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security
     Policy/European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations of the European
     External Action Service (EEAS) of 27 December 2017 on the verdicts of Wu Gan and
     Xie Yang in China,

–    having regard to the Local Statement by the Delegation of the European Union on
     International Human Rights Day, 8 December 2017,

–    having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948,

–    having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 16
     December 1966,

–    having regard to Rules 135(5) and 123(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas the promotion of and respect for universal human rights, democracy and the
     rule of law should remain at the centre of the long-standing relationship between the EU
     and China, in accordance with the EU’s commitment to uphold these very same values
     in its external action and China’s expressed interest in adhering to them in its own
     development and international cooperation;

B.   whereas since President Xi Jinping assumed power, the human rights situation in China
     has deteriorated further, with the government stepping up its hostility toward peaceful
     dissent, the freedoms of expression and religion, and the rule of law; whereas the
     Chinese authorities have detained and prosecuted hundreds of human rights defenders,
     lawyers and journalists;

C.   whereas on 26 December 2017, a court in Tianjin sentenced activist Wu Gan to eight
     years in prison on charges of subverting state power; whereas Wu Gan routinely
     campaigned on sensitive issues relating to the government’s abuse of power, both online
     and offline; whereas according to his lawyer, Wu Gan rejected a deal with the
     authorities which would have given him a suspended sentence if he were to have
     admitted his guilt;

D.   whereas on the very same day in Hunan, human rights lawyer Xie Yang was also
     convicted but exempted from criminal penalties after he earlier pleaded guilty to
     subversion charges; whereas Wu Gan was arrested months before an unprecedented
     crackdown on human rights lawyers and defenders in 2015 that saw hundreds of people,
     including Xie Yang, questioned or detained nationwide over a few weeks; whereas there
     are allegations that Xie Yang has been tortured, beaten and threatened by interrogators;

E.   whereas on 28 November 2017, Yueyang Intermediate Court sentenced democracy
     activist Lee Ming-che to five years in prison after finding him guilty on charges of
     ‘subverting State power’, and stripped him of all political rights in China for two years;
     whereas it is likely that Lee Ming-che’s public confession was made under pressure
     from the Chinese authorities; whereas Lee Ming-che had gone missing on 19 March
     2017, after he crossed from Macau into Zhuhai in China’s Guangdong province;

F.   whereas Tashi Wangchuk, a Tibetan shopkeeper and language rights advocate, was
     detained on 27 January 2016 after he appeared in a New York Times video advocating
     the right of Tibetans to learn and study in their mother tongue; whereas in March 2016
     Tashi Wangchuk was charged with ‘inciting separatism’ and faces up to 15 years in
     prison, although he told the newspaper explicitly that he was not calling for Tibetan
     independence;

G.   whereas in 2015 the Tibetan monk Choekyi, from Phurbu monastery in Sichuan’s Seda
     county, was jailed for celebrating the birthday of exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama;
     whereas after being charged, Choekyi was briefly held in a prison in Kangding county
     in Ganzi prefecture, and was finally sent to Sichuan’s Mianyang prison to serve a four-
     year term; whereas according to media sources, Choekyi had kidney problems,
     jaundice, and other health-related issues which got worse because of his detention;

H.   whereas human rights lawyers have continued to face intimidation and imprisonment, as
     in the cases of prominent lawyers Li Yuhan, who has been incommunicado since
     November 2017, and Wang Quanzhang, who was arrested in July 2015, held
     incommunicado for over 800 days and reportedly subjected to torture; whereas human
     rights defenders who are petitioners who travel to major cities to raise local issues face
     detention and imprisonment, as with Li Xiaoling, who has been in detention since June
     2017 while continuing to suffer from a severe case of glaucoma; whereas human rights
     defenders who provide a platform for petitioners and other human rights defenders, such
     as Ding Lingjie, Liu Feiyue and Zhen Jianghua, have also been detained;

I.   whereas the Chinese Government has passed new laws, notably the State Security Law,
     the Counterterrorism Law, the Cybersecurity Law, and the Foreign NGO Management
     Law, that cast public activism and peaceful criticism of the government as state security
     threats, strengthen censorship, surveillance and the control of individuals and social
     groups, and deter individuals from campaigning for human rights;

J.   whereas in the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and
     Democracy, the Council pledges that the EU will promote democracy, the rule of law
     and ‘human rights in all areas of its external action without exception’ and will ‘place
     human rights at the centre of its relations with all third countries, including its strategic
     partners’;

1.   Remains highly concerned by the Chinese Government’s approach towards human
     rights defenders, activists and lawyers; reminds China of its responsibilities as a global
     power and calls on the Beijing authorities to ensure in all circumstances respect for
     human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Universal Declaration
     of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments signed or ratified by
     China; urges the Beijing authorities, moreover, to put an end to all acts of harassment
     against all human rights defenders in the country so that they are able to carry out their
     work without hindrance;

2.   Urges the Chinese authorities to release immediately and unconditionally all human
     rights defenders, activists, lawyers, journalists and petitioners being detained for their
     human rights work, and to end the ongoing crackdown against them, which is being
     perpetrated in the form of detention, judicial harassment and intimidation;

3.   Calls on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to release Wu Gan

      immediately and unconditionally, as he has been imprisoned solely for peacefully
      exercising his right to freedom of expression and assembly, and – pending his release –
      to ensure that he has regular, unrestricted access to his family and lawyers of his choice,
      and is not subjected to torture or other ill-treatment; calls for a prompt, effective and
      impartial investigation into torture in China and for those responsible to be brought to
      justice;

4.    Emphasises the need to investigate the allegations of torture of Xie Yang;

5.    Calls on the Chinese authorities to release Lee Ming-che immediately and
      unconditionally, and – pending his release – to ensure that he is protected from torture
      and other ill-treatment, and allowed access to his family, lawyers of his choice and
      adequate medical care;

6.    Expresses its deep concern at the arrest and continued detention of Tashi Wangchuk, as
      well as his limited right to counsel, the lack of evidence against him and the
      irregularities in the criminal investigation; calls for the immediate and unconditional
      release of Tashi Wangchuk;

7.    Calls on the Chinese authorities to release the Tibetan monk Choekyi immediately and
      unconditionally; urges the Chinese Government to allow his relatives and the lawyers of
      his choice to visit him and, in particular, to provide him with adequate medical care;

8.    Calls on the Chinese Government to respect its own constitution, in particular with
      regard to Article 4, which protects national minorities; Article 35, which protects the
      freedoms of speech, the press, assembly, association, procession and demonstration;
      Article 36, which recognises the right to freedom of religious belief; and Article 41,
      which guarantees the right to criticise and make suggestions regarding any state organ
      or functionary;

9.    Reiterates its call on the Chinese Government to engage with His Holiness the Dalai
      Lama and his representatives, and expresses its support for a peaceful resolution of the
      issue of Tibet through dialogue and negotiations with a view to granting Tibet genuine
      autonomy within the framework of the Chinese Constitution;

10.   Condemns, moreover, the anti-Buddhism campaigns carried out via the ‘patriotic
      education’ approach, including measures to state-manage Tibetan Buddhist
      Monasteries; is concerned that China’s criminal law is being abused to persecute
      Tibetans and Buddhists, whose religious activities are equated with ‘separatism’;
      deplores the fact that the environment for practising Buddhism in Tibet has worsened
      significantly after the Tibetan protests of March 2008, with the Chinese Government
      adopting a more pervasive approach to ‘patriotic education’;

11.   Is worried about the adoption of the package of security laws and its impact on
      minorities in China, particularly the Counterterrorism Law, which could lead to the
      penalisation of peaceful expression of Tibetan culture and religion, and the Foreign
      NGO Management Law, which places human rights groups under the strict control of
      the government, as this constitutes a strictly top-down approach instead of encouraging
      partnership between local and central government and civil society;

12.   Emphasises that the Chinese authorities must ensure that all those held incommunicado

      are immediately put in contact with their family members and lawyers, and the
      conditions of all those in detention must meet the standards set out in the ‘Body of
      Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or
      Imprisonment’, adopted by UN General Assembly resolution 43/173 of 9 December
      1988, including access to medical care;

13.   Is highly concerned to learn about allegations of torture of human rights activists; calls
      on the Chinese Government, therefore, to wholeheartedly respect the absolute and non-
      derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
      punishment, in accordance with Articles 2 and 16 of the UN Convention against Torture
      and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT), which was
      ratified by China on 4 October 1988;

14.   Encourages the Chinese Government, as the 20th anniversary of its signature
      approaches, to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to
      ensure its full implementation, including by ending all abusive practices and adapting its
      legislation as necessary;

15.   Recalls that it is important that the EU raises the issue of human rights violations in
      China, in particular the case of minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, at every political and
      human rights dialogue with the Chinese authorities, including the yearly human rights
      dialogues, in line with its commitment to project a strong, clear and unified voice in its
      approach to the country; regrets, however, the lack of concrete results from the yearly
      EU-China human rights dialogues; further recalls that in its ongoing reform process and
      increasing global engagement, China has opted into the international human rights
      framework by signing up to a wide range of international human rights treaties; calls,
      therefore, for dialogue to be pursued with China in order to honour these commitments;

16.   Calls on all the Member States to adopt a firm, values-based approach towards China
      and expects them not to undertake unilateral initiatives or acts that might undermine the
      coherence, effectiveness and consistency of EU action; recalls with deep regret the
      failure of the EU to make a statement on human rights in China at the UN’s Human
      Rights Council in Geneva in June 2017; welcomes the adoption of a statement at the
      following session, and expects the EU to continue to mention China as a country which
      requires the Human Rights Council’s attention for as long as it refuses to engage in
      meaningful rights reforms; further calls for the EU and its Member States to raise robust
      concerns during the forthcoming Universal Periodic Review for China and to ensure, in
      particular, that Chinese civil society can freely participate in the process;

17.   Invites the VP/HR and the Member States to adopt the Foreign Affairs Council’s
      conclusions on China, which stress the critical importance of human rights in the EU-
      China relationship and convey a clear sense of concern about the negative trends in
      China in this regard, together with the expectation that the Chinese authorities take
      specific steps in response; stresses that such conclusions would serve to bind the 28 EU
      Member States and EU institutions to a common message and approach with regard to
      human rights in China;

18.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Vice-President of the
      Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security
      Policy, the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member
      States, and the Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of China.

–    having regard to ‘Charter 08’, a manifesto drawn up by over 350 Chinese political

     anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

–    having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 16
     December 1966,

–    having regard to Rules 135(5) and 123(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas Liu Xiaobo, the prominent Chinese writer and human rights activist, has been
     formally detained in prison four times over the course of the last 30 years; whereas Liu
     Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for ‘inciting subversion of state power’ after he
     helped to write a manifesto known as ‘Charter 08’; whereas the formal procedures
     followed in Liu Xiaobo’s prosecution have not allowed for him to be represented or be
     present himself at formal proceedings, and diplomats from over a dozen states,
     including several Member States, were denied access to the court for the duration of the
     trial;

B.   whereas Liu Xiaobo’s wife, Liu Xia, although never charged with any offence, has been
     under house arrest since he was awarded the Peace Prize in 2010, and has, since then,
     been denied almost all human contact, except with close family and a few friends;

C.   whereas, on 8 October 2010, the Nobel Committee awarded Liu Xiaobo the Nobel
     Peace Prize in recognition of his ‘long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human
     rights in China’;

D.   whereas Liu Xiaobo has recently been transferred from a prison in China’s northeast
     Liaoning province to a hospital in the provincial capital Shenyang, where he is being
     treated for his serious health condition after having been diagnosed with late-stage liver
     cancer;

E.   whereas the Chinese authorities rejected requests by Liu Xiaobo and his wife to seek
     medical treatment outside China or to move him to his home in Beijing;

F.   whereas, on 29 June 2017, 154 Nobel Laureates issued a joint letter to the President of
     the People’s Republic of China urging the Chinese Government to allow Liu Xiaobo
     and his wife Liu Xia to travel abroad for medical treatment;

G.   whereas Lee Ming-che, the noted Taiwanese pro-democracy activist known for his
     human rights advocacy through social media, went missing on 19 March 2017 after
     crossing from Macau into Zhuhai in China’s Guangdong province; whereas China’s
     Taiwan Affairs Office confirmed at a news conference that the ‘relevant authorities’ had
     detained Lee and placed him under investigation on suspicion of ‘engaging in activities
     that endanger national security’;

H.   whereas the Chinese authorities have offered no credible evidence for the grave
     allegations against Lee Ming-che; whereas Lee’s detainment comes at a juncture during
     which cross-straits relations are deteriorating; whereas Lee was active in providing
     information about the democratic political culture of Taiwan to his friends in China
     through online platforms susceptible to Chinese government monitoring;

I.   whereas China has progressed in the last few years in terms of realising economic and
     social rights, reflecting its priorities for the people’s right to subsistence, while, since
     2013, the human rights situation in China has continued to deteriorate with the

     government stepping up its hostility toward peaceful dissent, the rule of law, freedom of
     expression and freedom of religion, as in the recent case of Bishop Peter Shao Zhumin,
     who was forcibly removed from his diocese in Wenzhou on 18 May 2017;

J.   whereas the Chinese Government has passed new laws, in particular, the State Security
     Law, the Counterterrorism Law, the Cybersecurity Law, and the Foreign NGO
     Management Law, which have been utilised to persecute those engaging in public
     activism and peaceful criticism of the government as state security threats, as well as to
     strengthen censorship, the surveillance and control of individuals and social groups and
     to deter individuals from campaigning for human rights and the rule of law;

K.   whereas, last month, the Greek Government refused to endorse an EU statement
     criticising the crackdown on activists and dissidents in China that was due to be
     submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on 15 June 2017;
     whereas this was the first occasion on which the EU had failed to make such a statement
     before the UN’s top rights body;

L.   whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
     should remain at the centre of the long-standing relationship between the EU and China,
     in line with the EU’s commitment to uphold these values in its external action and with
     China’s expressed interest in adhering to these very values in its own development and
     international cooperation;

1.   Calls on the Chinese Government to release, immediately and unconditionally, the 2010
     Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu Xia from house arrest and allow
     him to obtain medical treatment wherever they wish;

2.   Urges the Chinese authorities to allow Lui Xiaobo unrestricted access to family, friends,
     and legal counsel;

3.   Calls on the Chinese authorities to release Lee Ming-che immediately, as no credible
     evidence related to his case has been provided, to disclose information about his exact
     whereabouts, and to ensure, in the meantime, that Lee Ming-che is protected from
     torture and other ill-treatment, and that he is allowed access to his family, a lawyer of
     his choice and adequate medical care;

4.   Remains highly concerned by the Chinese Government’s continued efforts to silence
     civil society actors, including human rights defenders, activists and lawyers;

5.   Recalls the importance of the EU raising the issue of human rights violations in China
     during every political and human rights dialogue with the Chinese authorities, in line
     with the EU’s commitment to project a strong, clear and unified voice in its approach to
     the country, including at the regular and more result-oriented Human Rights Dialogues;
     recalls, further, that, in the context of its ongoing reform process and increasing global
     engagement, China has opted into the international human rights framework by signing
     up to a wide range of international human rights treaties; calls, therefore, for the
     dialogue with China to be pursued in order to live up to these commitments;

6.   Encourages China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;

7.   Regrets the failure of the EU to make a statement on human rights in China at the UN’s
     Human Rights Council in Geneva in June 2017; calls on all EU Member States to adopt

     a firm, values-based approach towards China and expects them not to undertake
     unilateral initiatives or acts that might undermine the coherence, effectiveness and
     consistency of EU action;

8.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
     Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign
     Affairs and Security Policy, and the Government and Parliament of the People’s
     Republic of China.

   belonging to minorities such as Tibetans and Uighurs’ and ‘encouraged China to resume a

– having regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 16 December
  1966,

– having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948,

– having regard to Rules 135(5) and 123(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas the promotion of and respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law
   should remain at the centre the long-standing partnership between the EU and China, in
   line with the EU’s commitment to uphold these values in its external action and China’s
   expressed interest in adhering to these same values in its own development and
   international cooperation;

B. whereas, in its development objectives, the Chinese Government has indicated that it is
   seeking a greater role in addressing global challenges, such as international peace and
   security and climate change, and increased influence over both political and economic
   global governance, and has committed to strengthening the rule of law;

C. whereas the 17th EU-China Summit of 29 June 2015 lifted bilateral relations to a new
   level, and whereas in its strategic framework on human rights and democracy the EU
   pledges that it will place human rights at the centre of its relations with all third countries,
   including its strategic partners; whereas the 18th EU-China Summit of 12-13 July 2016
   concluded that another round of the human rights dialogue between EU and China would
   be held still in 2016;

D. whereas China has made progress over the last decades in the realisation of economic and
   social rights, reflecting its stated priorities regarding people’s rights to subsistence and
   development, but its achievements in the area of political and civil rights, together with
   the promotion of human rights, are limited;

E. whereas, during 34th EU-China Dialogue on Human Rights held in Beijing on 2
   December 2015, the EU raised its concerns about respect for the rights of persons
   belonging to minorities, especially in Tibet and Xinjiang, and about respect for freedom of
   religion or belief; whereas the case of Ilham Tohti was discussed during the 34th EU-
   China Dialogue on Human Rights;

F. whereas the Larung Gar Institute, the largest Tibetan Buddhist centre in the world founded
   in 1980, is currently facing extensive demolition by the Chinese Government with the
   objective of downsizing the academy by fifty percent, evicting around 4 600 residents by
   force and destroying around 1 500 dwellings; whereas according to the Chinese
   authorities this demolition is necessary in order to carry out ‘correction and rectification’;

G. whereas the evictees are to be forcibly enrolled in so-called ‘patriotic education’
   exercises; whereas three nuns at the academy committed suicide in protest at the ongoing
   large-scale demolitions at Larung Gar;

H. whereas an extremely high number of Tibetans, mostly monks and nuns, have reportedly
   set themselves on fire since 2009 in protest against restrictive Chinese policies in Tibet
   and in support of the return of the Dalai Lama and the right to religious freedom in the
   Aba/Ngaba county prefecture in Sichuan Province and other parts of the Tibetan plateau;

I. whereas envoys of His Holiness the Dalai Lama have approached the Government of the
   People’s Republic of China to find a mutually beneficial solution to the issue of Tibet;
   whereas no progress has been made in the resolution of the Tibetan crisis in the last few
   years, as the last round of talks took place in 2010 and the negotiations are currently
   frozen;

J. whereas the Uighur economics professor Ilham Tohti was sentenced to life imprisonment
   on 23 September 2014 on the charge of alleged separatism after being arrested in January
   of the same year; whereas seven of his former students were also detained and condemned
   to prison sentences of between three and eight years for alleged collaboration with Mr
   Tohti;

K. whereas there are allegations that the due process of law was not respected, in particular
   with regard to the right to a proper defence;

L. whereas the Xinjiang region, in which the Muslim Uighur ethnic minority is mainly
   located, has experienced repeated outbreaks of ethnic unrest and violence; whereas Ilham
   Tohti has always rejected separatism and violence and sought reconciliation based on
   respect for Uighur culture;

1. Urges the Chinese authorities to stop the demolition of Larung Gar and the eviction of its
   residents, and in this way to respect the freedom of religion in accordance with its
   international commitments in the field of human rights;

2. Calls on the Chinese authorities to initiate a dialogue and to engage constructively on
   developments in Larung Gar with the local community and its religious leaders, and to
   address concerns regarding overcrowded religious institutes by allowing Tibetans to
   establish more institutes and build more facilities; calls for adequate compensation and the
   re-housing of Tibetans who have been evicted during the demolitions in Larung Gar at the
   place of their choice to continue their religious activities;

3. Deplores the sentencing of ten Tibetans by the Intermediate People’s Court in Barkham to
   different terms ranging from 5 to 14 years in prison for taking part in an 80th birthday
   celebration of His Holiness the Dalai Lana in Ngaba County;

4. Is deeply concerned by the deterioration of the human rights situation in Tibet which has
   led to an increase in the number of self-immolation cases; criticises the increase in
   military displays on the Tibetan plateau that will only lead to escalating tension in the
   region; condemns the increase in the use of surveillance systems in Tibetan private
   households;

5. Is worried about the increasingly repressive regime faced by different minorities, in
   particular Tibetans and Uighurs, as additional constraints are put on the constitutional
   guarantees of their right to freedom of cultural expression and religious belief, and to the
   freedom of speech and expression, peaceful assembly and association, calling into
   question China’s stated commitment to the rule of law and respect for international
   obligations; demands that the authorities respect these fundamental freedoms;

6. Is worried about the adoption of the package of security laws and its impact on minorities
   in China, particularly the law on counter-terrorism that could lead to the penalisation of
   peaceful expression of Tibetan culture and religion and the law on the management of
   international NGOs which will come into effect on 1 January 2017 and will place human
   rights groups under the strict control of the government, as this constitutes a strictly top-
   down approach instead of encouraging partnership between local and central government
   and civil society;

7. Urges the Chinese Government to amend the provisions in the security law package that
   narrow the space for civil society organisations and tighten government control over
   religious practices; calls on the Chinese Government to provide and guarantee a fair and
   safe environment for all NGOs and human rights defenders to operate freely in the
   country, which could greatly complement the state delivery of social services with a
   bottom-up approach and contribute to the advancement of social and economic, political
   and civil rights;

8. Calls on the Chinese Government to resume the dialogue with Tibetan representatives,
   which was ended by China in 2010, in order to find an inclusive political solution to the
   crisis in Tibet; calls for respect for the freedoms of expression, association and religion of
   the Tibetan people as enshrined in the Constitution; believes that respect for minority
   rights is a key element of democracy and the rule of law that is indispensable for political
   stability;

9. Strongly condemns the imprisonment of Ilham Tohti who is serving a life sentence on
   alleged charges of separatism; deplores the fact that the due process of law was not
   respected and that he did not benefit from the right to a proper defence; urges the Chinese
   authorities to respect the norm of granting one visit per month for family members;

10. Calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Ilham Tohti and of his supporters
    detained in relation to his case; further calls for Ilham Tohti’s teaching permit to be
    restored and for his free movement to be guaranteed within and outside China;

11. Recalls the importance of the EU raising the issue of human rights violations in China, in
    particular the case of minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, at every political and human rights

   dialogue with the Chinese authorities, in line with the EU’s commitment to project a
   strong, clear and unified voice in its approach to the country, including the yearly Human
   Rights Dialogues; further points out that, as part of its ongoing reform process and
   increasing global engagement, China has opted into the international human rights
   framework by signing up to a wide range of international human rights treaties, and
   therefore calls for dialogue to be pursued with China to live up to these commitments;

12. Deplores the fact that the 35th round of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue will
    probably not take place before the end of 2016, as agreed; urges the Chinese Government
    to agree to a high-level dialogue in the first weeks of 2017;

13. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Vice-President of the Commission /
    High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the Council, the
    Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, and the Government
    and the Parliament of the Peoples’ Republic of China.

  the adoption of the new law on cybersecurity on 7 November 2016,

– having regard to Rules 135(5) and 123(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas Gui Minhai, a book publisher and shareholder of the publishing house and of a
   bookstore selling literary works critical of Beijing, disappeared in Pattaya, Thailand, on 17
   October 2015 without trace;

B. whereas between October and December 2015 four other Hong Kong residents (Lui Bo,
   Zhang Zhiping, Lam Wing-Kee and Lee Bo) who worked for the same bookstore also
   disappeared;

C. whereas Gui Minhai is a Swedish citizen of Chinese origin and therefore an EU citizen;

D. whereas on 17 January 2016 Gui Minhai appeared in a Chinese TV broadcast and
   apparently acknowledged that he had voluntarily returned to mainland China in order to
   be judged for a supposed crime involving a car accident in 2003; whereas there are serious
   reasons to believe his appearance on TV was staged and that he was given a script to read
   from;

E. whereas Gui Minhai has been under arrest for more than a year, incommunicado, and
   whereas his whereabouts are unknown; whereas Gui Minhai is the only bookseller of the
   group still in prison;

F. whereas the Swedish authorities have asked for the Chinese authorities’ full support in
   protecting the rights of their citizen, as well as those of the other ‘disappeared’
   individuals; whereas neither Gui Minhai’s family nor the Swedish Government has been
   informed of any formal charges against him, or of the formal place of his detention;

G. whereas Lui Bo and Zhang Zhiping were allowed to return to Hong Kong on 4 March and
   8 March 2016 respectively after being detained in mainland China; whereas they asked the
   police to drop their respective cases and went back to mainland China on the same day
   they had arrived; whereas Lee Bo returned to Hong Kong on 24 March 2016 and denies
   having been kidnapped; whereas Lam Wing-Kee returned to Hong Kong on 16 June 2016;

H. whereas in June 2016, Lam Wing-Kee, one of the publishers, returned to Hong Kong to
   close the inquiry into his disappearance, but instead of returning to the mainland, he told
   the media that he had been abducted by Chinese security services, kept isolated and forced
   to confess to crimes he had not committed in front of TV cameras;

I. whereas Hong Kong upholds and protects freedom of speech, expression and publication;
   whereas the publication of any material critical of the Chinese leadership is legal in Hong
   Kong, although banned in mainland China; whereas the ‘one country, two systems’

   principle guarantees Hong Kong’s autonomy from Beijing with respect to such freedoms
   as are enshrined in Article 27 of the Basic Law;

J. whereas in the 2015 Annual Report on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the
   EEAS and the Commission consider the case of the five book publishers to be the most
   serious challenge to Hong Kong’s Basic Law and the ‘one country, two systems’ principle
   since Hong Kong’s return to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1997; whereas only
   legal enforcement agencies in Hong Kong have the legal authority to enforce the law in
   Hong Kong;

K. whereas the UN Committee Against Torture has reported its serious concerns over
   consistent reports from various sources about a continuing practice of illegal detention in
   unrecognised and unofficial detention places, the so-called ‘black jails’; whereas it has
   also expressed serious concerns over consistent reports indicating that the practice of
   torture and ill-treatment is still deeply entrenched in the criminal justice system, which
   places over-reliance on confessions as the basis for convictions;

L. whereas China has signed but not yet ratified the International Covenant on Civil and
   Political Rights (ICCPR); whereas China has neither signed nor ratified the International
   Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances;

M. whereas the 17th EU-China Summit of 29 June 2015 lifted bilateral relations to a new
   level, and whereas in its strategic framework on human rights and democracy the EU
   pledges that it will place human rights at the centre of its relations with all third countries,
   including its strategic partners; whereas the 18th EU-China Summit of 12-13 July 2016
   concluded with a statement saying there would be another round of the human rights
   dialogue between the EU and China before the end of 2016;

1. Expresses its grave concern over the lack of knowledge of the whereabouts of Gui
   Minhai; calls for the immediate publication of detailed information on his whereabouts
   and calls for his immediate safe release and for him to be given the right to
   communication;

2. Notes with concern the allegations that mainland China’s enforcement agencies are
   operating in Hong Kong; reminds the Chinese authorities that any operation of their law
   enforcement agencies in Hong Kong would be inconsistent with the ‘one country, two
   systems’ principle;

3. Urges the relevant authorities in Thailand, China and Hong Kong to clarify the
   circumstances of the disappearances in conformity with the rule of law;

4. Strongly condemns all cases of human rights violations, in particular arbitrary arrests,
   rendition, forced confessions, secret detention, incommunicado custody and violations of
   the freedom of publication and expression; recalls that the independence of book editors,
   journalists and bloggers must be safeguarded; calls for an immediate end to human rights
   violations and political intimidation;

5. Condemns restrictions on and the criminalisation of freedom of expression, and deplores
   the tightening of restrictions on freedom of expression; calls on the Chinese Government
   to stop suppressing the free flow of information including by restricting the use of the
   internet;

6. Expresses its concern about the new law on cybersecurity, adopted on 7 November 2016,
   which would bolster and institutionalise the practices of cyberspace censorship and
   monitoring, and about the adopted national security law and the draft law on counter-
   terrorism; notes the fears of Chinese reformist lawyers and civil rights defenders that these
   laws will further restrict freedom of expression and that self-censorship will grow;

7. Calls on China to release or drop all charges against peaceful government critics, anti-
   corruption activists, lawyers and journalists;

8. Expresses its concern at the forthcoming entry into force of the new Foreign NGO
   Management Law on 1 January 2017, given that it would drastically hamper the activities
   of Chinese civil society and would severely restrict the freedoms of association and
   expression in the country, including by banning overseas NGOs that are not registered
   with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security and prohibiting provincial public security
   departments from funding any Chinese individual or organisation, and prohibiting Chinese
   groups from conducting ‘activities’ on behalf of, or with the authorisation of, non-
   registered overseas NGOs, including those based in Hong Kong and Macao; calls on the
   Chinese authorities to provide a safe and fair environment and transparent processes
   which allow NGOs to operate freely and effectively in China;

9. Underlines the European Union’s commitment to strengthening democracy, including the

China’s market economy status
European Parliament resolution of 12 May 2016 on China’s market economy status
(2016/2667(RSP))

The European Parliament,

– having regard to the EU’s anti-dumping legislation (Council Regulation (EC) No
  1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries
  not members of the European Community1),

– having regard to China’s Accession Protocol to the World Trade Organisation (WTO),

– having regard to its previous resolutions on EU-China trade relations,

– having regard to Rule 123(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas the European Union and China are two of the biggest traders in the world, with
   China being the EU’s second biggest trading partner and the EU being China’s biggest
   trading partner, and with daily trade flows of well over EUR 1 billion between them;

B. whereas in 2015 investment from China into the EU for the first time exceeded investment
   from the EU into China; whereas the Chinese market has been the main engine of
   profitability for a number of EU industries and brands;

C. whereas, when China joined the WTO, an arrangement for this accession allowed for a
   specific methodology for the calculation of dumping, which was introduced in Section 15
   of the Accession Protocol and serves as a basis for different treatment for Chinese
   imports;

D. whereas any decision on how to deal with imports from China after December 2016 must
   ensure compliance of EU law with WTO rules;

E. whereas the provisions of Section 15 of China’s Accession Protocol to the WTO that
   remain in force after 2016 provide a basis for the application of a non-standard
   methodology to imports from China after 2016;



1
    OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.

F. whereas, given the current level of state influence on the Chinese economy, firms’
   decisions on prices, costs, outputs and inputs do not respond to market signals reflecting
   supply and demand;

G. whereas, in its Accession Protocol, China has committed, inter alia, to allowing all its
   prices to be determined by market forces, and whereas the EU must ensure that China
   complies fully with its WTO obligations;

H. whereas China’s overcapacity is already having strong social, economic and
   environmental consequences in the EU, as demonstrated by its recent detrimental impact
   on the EU steel sector, in particular in the United Kingdom, and whereas the social impact
   on EU jobs of granting market economy status (MES) to China could be substantial;

I. whereas 56 of the 73 anti-dumping measures currently in force in the EU apply to Chinese
   imports;

J. whereas the recently concluded public consultation on the possible granting of MES to
   China could provide additional information which may be useful in addressing the issue;

K. whereas the Commission communication of 10 October 2012 entitled ‘A stronger
   European industry for growth and economic recovery’ (COM(2012)0582) sets the
   objective of raising industry’s share of EU GDP to 20 % by 2020;

1. Reiterates the importance of the EU partnership with China, in which free and fair trade
   and investment play an important role;

2. Stresses that China is not a market economy and that the five criteria established by the
   EU to define market economies have not yet been fulfilled;

3. Urges the Commission to coordinate with the EU’s major trading partners, including in
   the context of the upcoming G7 and G20 summits, on how best to ensure that all
   provisions of Section 15 of China’s Accession Protocol to the WTO that remain in force
   after 2016 are given full legal meaning under their domestic procedures, and to oppose
   any unilateral granting of MES to China;

4. Stresses that, in the upcoming EU-China summit, the issues surrounding MES should be
   discussed;

5. Calls on the Commission to take due account of the concerns expressed by EU industry,
   trade unions and other stakeholders as to the consequences for EU jobs, the environment,
   standards and sustainable economic growth in all the manufacturing sectors affected and
   for EU industry as a whole, and ensure, in this context, that EU jobs are defended;

6. Is convinced that, until China meets all five EU criteria required to qualify as a market
   economy, the EU should use a non-standard methodology in anti-dumping and anti-
   subsidy investigations into Chinese imports in determining price comparability, in
   accordance with and giving full effect to those parts of Section 15 of China’s Accession
   Protocol which provide room for the application of a non-standard methodology; calls on
   the Commission to make a proposal in line with this principle;

7. In parallel, stresses the imminent need for a general reform of the EU’s trade defence
   instruments in order to guarantee a level playing field for EU industry with China and
   other trading partners in full compliance with WTO rules; calls on the Council to rapidly

   seek agreement with Parliament on the modernisation of the Union’s trade defence
   instruments;

8. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the
   governments and parliaments of the Member States.

  on the fifth periodic report of China adopted at its 1391st and 1392nd meetings, held on

– having regard to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the
  People’s Republic of China (hereinafter ‘the Basic Law’), in particular the articles on
  personal freedoms and freedom of the press, and to the Hong Kong Bill of Rights
  Ordinance,

– having regard to Rules 135(5) and 123(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas, over the last four months, five booksellers (Lui Bo, Gui Minhai, Zhang Zhiping,
   Lin Rongji and Lee Po), four of them resident in Hong Kong and one non-resident,
   associated with the publishing house Mighty Current and its bookstore, who sold literary
   works critical of Beijing, have gone missing under mysterious circumstances; whereas
   two of them are EU citizens – Gui Minhai, a Swedish national, and Lee Po, a British
   national; whereas in January 2016 confirmation was received that both EU citizens were
   in mainland China, and, whereas there are suspicions that the remaining three are also
   there; whereas Lee Po was temporarily reunited with his wife on 23 January 2016 in an
   undisclosed location in mainland China; whereas the continuing lack of information about
   their well-being and whereabouts is extremely worrying;

B. whereas there have been persuasive media allegations, and concerns on the part of
   lawmakers, human rights organisations and numerous civilians, that the five booksellers
   were abducted by China’s mainland authorities; whereas, in particular, Lee Po was
   abducted from Hong Kong and Gui Minhai vanished from his home in Thailand;

C. whereas on 10 January 2016 thousands of protesters in Hong Kong gathered in the streets
   to demand action from the city government to explain the disappearance of the five
   booksellers; whereas these disappearances follow a series of violent attacks in 2013 and
   2014 against Hong Kong journalists critical of Beijing;

D. whereas Hong Kong upholds and protects the freedom of speech, expression and
   publication; whereas the publication of any material critical of Chinese leadership is legal
   in Hong Kong, although banned in mainland China; whereas the ‘one country, two
   systems’ principle guarantees Hong Kong’s autonomy from Beijing with respect to such
   freedoms as are enshrined in Article 27 of the Basic Law;

E. whereas revelations have been published that 14 publishers and 21 publications in Hong
   Kong were identified as targets in an internal document of the Communist party of April
   2015, in which a strategy to ‘exterminate’ banned books at their sources in Hong Kong

   and Macau was divulged; whereas the fear of reprisals has led some booksellers in Hong
   Kong to remove books critical of China from their shelves;

F. whereas mainland China’s government tightly restricts and criminalises freedom of
   expression, particularly through censorship; whereas China’s internet ‘Great Firewall’
   allows the government to censor any politically unacceptable information; whereas China
   maintains strict curbs on freedom of expression, and the popularity of books critical of
   China with readers in mainland China is considered a threat to social stability;

G. whereas on 17 January 2016 Gui Minhai released a media statement in mainland China,
   maintaining that he travelled voluntarily to mainland China and admitting in what
   appeared to be a forced confession to an earlier drunk driving conviction;

H. whereas both the Swedish and the British authorities have asked for the Chinese
   authorities’ full support in protecting the rights of their two citizens as well as the other
   ‘disappeared’ individuals;

I. whereas the UN Committee Against Torture has reported its serious concerns over
   consistent reports from various sources about a continuing practice of illegal detention in
   unrecognised and unofficial detention places, the so-called ‘black jails’; whereas it has
   also expressed serious concerns over consistent reports indicating that the practice of
   torture and ill-treatment is still deeply entrenched in the criminal justice system, which
   places over-reliance on confessions as the basis for convictions;

J. whereas China has, officially and nominally, accepted the universality of human rights
   and in the past three decades has opted into the international human rights framework by
   signing a wide range of human rights treaties, and has thus become part of the
   international legal and institutional human rights framework;

K. whereas Article 27 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s de facto constitution, guarantees
   ‘freedom of speech, of the press and of publication, freedom of association, of assembly,
   of procession and of demonstration’; whereas the Basic Law, negotiated between China
   and the United Kingdom, guarantees these rights for a 50-year period ending in 2047;

L. whereas the 17th EU-China Summit, of 29 June 2015, lifted bilateral relations to a new
   level, and whereas in its strategic framework on human rights and democracy the EU
   pledges that it will place human rights at the centre of its relations with all third countries,
   including its strategic partners;

M. whereas the EU and China have engaged in human rights dialogues since 1995, and
   whereas both sides consider human rights to be an important part of their bilateral
   relations;

N. whereas according to the 21st annual report (July 2014) of the Hong Kong Journalists
   Association, 2014 has been the darkest year for press freedom in Hong Kong for several
   decades; whereas some journalists have been physically attacked or sacked while others
   expressing critical views have been moved to less sensitive areas;

1. Expresses its grave concern over the lack of knowledge about the whereabouts and
   well-being of the five missing booksellers; calls for the immediate publication of detailed
   information on the whereabouts and well-being of Lee Po and Gui Minhai, and calls for
   their immediate safe release and for them to be given the right of communication; calls for
   the immediate release of all other persons arbitrarily arrested for exercising their right to

   freedom of expression and publication in Hong Kong, including the three other
   booksellers;

2. Calls on the Chinese Government to report without delay any information relating to the
   missing booksellers, and to engage in immediate inclusive and transparent dialogue and
   communication on the matter between the mainland authorities and those in Hong Kong;
   notes as a positive development the communication from Lee Po and his reunification
   with his spouse;

3. Calls on the relevant authorities in China, Hong Kong and Thailand to investigate and
   clarify the circumstances surrounding the disappearances, in accordance with the rule of
   law, and, as far as possible, to assist in bringing the publishers home safely;

4. Expresses its concerns over allegations of mainland China’s law enforcement agencies
   operating in Hong Kong; recalls that it would be a violation of the Basic Law if mainland
   law enforcement agencies had been operating in Hong Kong; believes this would be
   inconsistent with the ‘one country, two systems’ principle; calls on China to respect the
   guarantees of autonomy granted to Hong Kong in the Basic Law;

5. Strongly condemns all cases of human rights violations, in particular arbitrary arrests,
   rendition, forced confessions, secret detention, incommunicado custody and violations of
   the freedom of publication and expression; recalls that the independence of book editors,
   journalists and bloggers must be safeguarded; calls for an immediate end to human rights
   violations and political intimidation;

6. Condemns restrictions and the criminalisation of freedom of expression, and deplores the
   tightening of restrictions on freedom of expression; calls on the Chinese Government to
   stop suppressing the free flow of information, including by restricting the use of the
   internet;

7. Expresses its concern at the imminent adoption of the draft Foreign NGO Management
   Law, given that in its current state it would drastically hamper the activities of Chinese
   civil society and would severely restrict the freedoms of association and expression in the
   country, including by banning overseas NGOs that are not registered with the Chinese
   Ministry of Public Security and prohibiting provincial public security departments from
   funding any Chinese individual or organisation, and Chinese groups from conducting
   ‘activities’ on behalf of, or with the authorisation of, non-registered overseas NGOs,
   including those based in Hong Kong and Macao; calls on the Chinese authorities to
   substantially revise this draft law in order to bring it into line with international human
   rights standards, including international commitments made by the People’s Republic of
   China;

8. Expresses its concern at the new draft law on cybersecurity, which would bolster and
   institutionalise the practices of cyberspace censorship and monitoring, and at the adopted
   national security law and the draft law on counter-terrorism; notes the fears of Chinese
   reformist lawyers and civil rights defenders that these laws will further restrict freedom of
   expression and that self-censorship will grow;

9. Believes that strong ongoing EU-China relations must provide an effective platform for a
   mature, meaningful and open human rights dialogue based on mutual respect;

10. Underlines the European Union’s commitment to strengthening democracy, including the
    rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, fundamental freedoms and rights,
    transparency, and freedom of information and expression in Hong Kong;

11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
    Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs
    and Security Policy, the Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of China
    and the Chief Executive and the Assembly of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
    Region.

(2013/2981(RSP))

The European Parliament,

– having regard to its resolutions of 7 September 20061 and 14 March 20132 on EU-China
  relations, of 13 December 2012 on the annual report on Human Rights and Democracy in
  the World 2011 and the European Union’s policy on the matter3, of 16 December 2010 on

  Member States’5,

– having regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular
  Article 3 thereof on the right to the integrity of the person,

– having regard to the hearings of 21 November 2009, 6 December 2012 and 2 December
  2013 by the Subcommittee on Human Rights and to the respective testimonies of former
  Canadian Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David
  Matas on the large-scale organ harvesting carried out on unwilling Falun Gong practitioners
  in China since 2000,

– having regard to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
  Treatment or Punishment, ratified by China on 4 October 1988,

– having regard to Rules 122(5) and 110(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas the People’s Republic of China performs more than 10 000 organ transplants per
   year and 165 Chinese organ transplant centres advertise that matching organs can be found
   within two to four weeks, yet as things stand China does not have an organised or effective
   public system of organ donation or distribution; whereas the organ transplant system in
   China does not comply with the World Health Organisation’s requirements for transparency
   and traceability in organ procurement pathways, and whereas the Chinese Government has
   resisted independent scrutiny of the system; whereas voluntary and informed consent is a
   precondition for ethical organ donation;

B. whereas the People’s Republic of China has extremely low rates of voluntary organ
   donation owing to traditional beliefs; whereas in 1984 China implemented regulations that
   permitted the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners;

5
    OJ C 161 E, 31.5.2011, p. 65.

C. whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China has failed to account adequately
   for the sources of excess organs when information has been requested by the former United
   Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
   punishment, Manfred Nowak, and by Canadian researchers David Matas, a human rights
   attorney, and David Kilgour, the former Canadian Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific;

D. whereas Huang Jiefu, Director of the China Organ Donation Committee and former
   Vice-Minister of Health, stated at the Madrid Conference on Organ Donation and
   Transplantation in 2010 that over 90 % of transplant organs extracted from deceased donors
   came from prisoners executed in China, and has said that by mid-2014 all hospitals licensed
   for organ transplants will be required to stop using organs from executed prisoners and only
   to use those voluntarily donated and allocated through a fledgling national system;

E. whereas the People’s Republic of China has announced its intention of phasing out the
   harvesting of organs from executed prisoners by 2015, as well as the introduction of a
   computerised organ allocation system known as the China Organ Transplant Response
   System (COTRS), thereby contradicting its commitment to the effect that all hospitals
   licensed for organ transplants will be required to stop using organs from executed prisoners
   by mid-2014;

F. whereas in July 1999 the Chinese Communist Party launched an intensive nationwide wave
   of persecution, designed to eradicate the spiritual practice of Falun Gong and leading to the
   arrest and detention of hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners; whereas there
   are reports that Uyghur and Tibetan prisoners have also been subjected to forced organ
   transplants;

G. whereas the UN Committee Against Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and
   other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have expressed concern over the
   allegations of organ harvesting from prisoners, and have called on the Government of the
   People’s Republic of China to increase the accountability and transparency of the organ
   transplant system and punish those responsible for abuses; whereas the killing of religious
   or political prisoners for the purpose of selling their organs for transplant is an egregious
   and intolerable violation of the fundamental right to life;

H. whereas on 12 November 2013 the UN General Assembly elected China to serve on the UN
   Human Rights Council for a period of three years beginning on 1 January 2014;

1. Expresses its deep concern over the persistent and credible reports of systematic,
   state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the
   People’s Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners
   imprisoned for their religious beliefs, as well as from members of other religious and ethnic
   minority groups;

2. Stresses that phasing out the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners only by 2015 is
   not acceptable; calls on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to end
   immediately the practice of harvesting organs from prisoners of conscience and members of
   religious and ethnic minority groups;

3. Calls for the EU and its Member States to raise the issue of organ harvesting in China;
   recommends that the Union and its Member States publicly condemn organ transplant
   abuses in China and raise awareness of this issue among their citizens travelling to China;

   calls for a full and transparent investigation by the EU into organ transplant practices in
   China, and for the prosecution of those found to have engaged in such unethical practices;

4. Calls on the Chinese authorities to respond thoroughly to the requests of the UN Special
   Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and
   the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief asking the Chinese Government
   to explain the sources of extra organs following the increase in the number of organ
   transplant operations, and to allow them to conduct an investigation into organ transplant
   practices in China;

5. Calls for the immediate release of all prisoners of conscience in China, including Falun
   Gong practitioners;

6. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs
   and Security Policy, the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, the United Nations

A. whereas trade between the EU and China has been growing rapidly and continuously in the
   last three decades, reaching a peak of total trade of EUR 433,8 billion in 2012, and whereas
   the imbalance in bilateral trade has been in China’s favour since 1997; whereas this trade
   deficit amounted to EUR 146 billion in 2012, compared with EUR 49 billion in 2000;

B. whereas the EU’s foreign investment stock in China in 2011 amounted to EUR 102 billion,

   billion; whereas in 2006 China’s foreign investment stock in the EU amounted to only EUR

C. whereas the Treaty of Lisbon made foreign direct investment (FDI) an exclusive

D. whereas 26 EU Member States have individual bilateral investment agreements in force

   challenges; whereas a higher level of integration and technological exchange between the
   EU and the Chinese economies could lead to synergies and mutual benefits;

G. whereas there should be a level playing-field for public and private companies;

H. whereas this investment agreement is the first to be negotiated by the EU on the basis of its
   overall competence following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon; whereas the
   negotiations on this investment agreement, including market access, have the potential to
   generate great interest as well as possible public concern, and should therefore be conducted
   with the highest possible level of transparency in order to enable the necessary
   parliamentary oversight, thus fulfilling one of the preconditions for the necessary consent of
   the European Parliament to the outcome of the negotiations;

I. whereas investors must comply with both the laws of the host country and the provisions of
   any agreement concluded by the EU and China once it enters into force in order to benefit
   fully from the best possible protection of their investments;

J. whereas the poor implementation or non-implementation by China of certain fundamental
   social and labour rights and environmental standards, which are, however, internationally
   recognised, are among the causes of the present imbalance in trade flows between the EU
   and China, which could be even further exacerbated by deeper investment relations if
   progress is not achieved in the implementation of those rights and standards; whereas the
   investment agreement should therefore not have the effect of further lowering social and
   environmental standards in China, but should, on the contrary, contribute to the
   improvement thereof as a precondition, leading to a more balanced and mutually beneficial
   trade and investment relationship;

K. whereas an investment agreement should also include investor obligations, including with
   regard to respect for trade union and other labour rights, transparency and protection of the
   environment, as defined in the law of each of the two parties, and should be concluded in
   compliance with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and other relevant international
   agreements and core conventions signed and ratified by the parties; whereas investment
   agreements should not cover investments in specially created zones that provide for the
   circumvention of labour rights and standards and other legal requirements;

L. whereas goods for export to the EU which are produced in forced labour camps, such as
   under the Re-education through Labour (RTL) system, generally known by the name
   Laogai, should not benefit from investments made under this bilateral investment
   agreement;

M. whereas the Commission and the Council have committed to ensuring that EU investment
   policy takes account of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external action,
   including human rights, and have committed to delivering as from 2013;

N. whereas, since an investment agreement with China would substantially upgrade EU-China
   economic relations, it should also make a contribution to upgrading the EU-China political
   dialogue, notably on such issues as human rights – in the framework of an effective and
   results-oriented human rights dialogue – and the rule of law, with a view to keeping
   political and economic relations on a parallel track, in accordance with the spirit of the
   Strategic Partnership;

O. whereas investors and investments should strive, through their management policies and
   practices, to be in line with the development objectives of the host states and local levels of
   government where the investment is located;

1. Welcomes the strengthening of economic relations between the EU and China; calls on the
   EU and on China to pursue a well-balanced relationship of partnership, regular high-level
   dialogue, and mutual benefits rather than engaging in confrontational competition;

2. Points out that China, having acceded to the WTO in 2001, should place more emphasis on
   liberalising its trade and opening its market in order to ensure a more level playing- field,
   and should accelerate removal of the artificial impediments that companies face in
   accessing the Chinese market;

3. Notes that European enterprises deplore the existence of numerous tariff and non-tariff
   barriers to the Chinese market, such as certain forms of discrimination against foreign
   operators, as well as the complexity of the tariff structure and the technical barriers to trade;

4. Welcomes the inclusion of market access in the negotiating mandate; believes that a
   reassurance on the part of China that market access will be included in the negotiations
   should constitute a precondition for launching them;

5. Stresses the need to explicitly include both FDI and portfolio investments in the negotiating
   process;

6. Notes that Chinese enterprises perceive the Union generally as a stable investment
   environment, but deplore what they see as the EU’s remaining export subsidies for
   European agricultural products and the existence of certain trade barriers to the EU market,
   such as technical obstacles to trade and barriers erected to block third-country investment in
   certain Member States, and that they are calling for the removal of the remaining unjustified
   barriers and the facilitation of investment in the Member States; recalls, however, that a
   security review mechanism to scrutinise foreign investments was recently set up in China
   and that the use of such mechanisms by both parties may be based on legitimate grounds;
   points out that the EU and China may have legitimate security concerns that justify total or
   partial exclusion of some sectors from foreign investment on a temporary or long-term
   basis;

7. Points out that currently the main form in which foreign companies are allowed to set up in
   China is through joint ventures, which are often associated with the transfer of strategic
   technologies that promote China’s competitive development to the detriment of European
   industry; is convinced that further openness on the part of China towards other legal
   regulations allowing foreign investors to set up, combined with due protection of
   intellectual property rights (IPRs), industrial property, brands and geographical indications
   of products, is crucial and would be mutually beneficial, as well as fostering a greater
   degree of integration of the European and Chinese economies on the basis of a more
   strategic approach to economic cooperation that is oriented, among other things, towards
   environment-friendly technology and innovation;

8. Is convinced that better protection of IPRs and effective implementation of related rules in
   China would greatly promote the objective of the EU and of other foreign investors of
   investing, sharing new technological capabilities and updating existing technologies in that
   country, in particular with regard to environmentally sound technologies;

9. Welcomes the efforts made by the Chinese authorities to improve respect for IPRs since
   China’s accession to the WTO, but still deplores their inadequate protection in China and
   considers regrettable the lack of specific means available to European businesses,
   particularly SMEs, to counter IPR infringements effectively;

10. Is concerned about the unreliability of China’s judicial system, which fails to enforce
    contractual obligations, and about the lack of transparency and uniformity in the application
    of the regulatory regime governing investments;

11. Urges the Commission to negotiate an ambitious and balanced EU-China investment
    agreement that seeks to create a better environment for EU investors in China and vice
    versa, including improved access to the market, in order to increase the level of reciprocal
    capital flows and guarantee transparency regarding governance of companies, both
    state-owned and private, which invest within the partner economy; recommends the
    Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines on corporate
    governance as a reference document; insists also on better law enforcement in order to
    ensure fair competition between public and private actors, curtail corruption and enhance
    the legal certainty and predictability of the business climate in China;

12. Underlines the importance of establishing, through this agreement, the preconditions for fair
    competition between the EU and China; recommends, to this end, that the Commission
    negotiate strong and binding provisions on transparency and fair competition so that a level
    playing-field also applies to state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds’ investment
    practices;

13. Calls for the agreement currently being negotiated to cover both market access and investor
    protection;

14. Stresses that nothing in the investment agreement should reduce the policy space of the
    parties and their capability to legislate in order to pursue legitimate and justified public
    policy purposes while trying not to nullify the benefits accruing from the commitments of
    the parties; emphasises that guaranteeing the rule of law for all EU and Chinese investors
    and citizens must remain the priority;

15. Calls on the Commission to ensure full transparency with regard to sovereign wealth funds;

16. Notes that a clear timeframe of negotiations should be established, and reasonable and
    meaningful transitional periods considered;

17. Considers that the investment agreement with China should be based on best practices
    drawn from Member States’ experiences, contribute to greater coherence and include the
    following standards:

   –     non-discrimination (national treatment and most-favoured-nation treatment for
         investors and investments in like circumstances);

   –     prohibition of manifest arbitrariness in decision-making;

   –     prohibition of the denial of justice and disregard for the fundamental principles of due
         process;

   –     the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory
         proceedings, in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the world’s
         principal legal systems;

   –     prohibition of abusive treatment of investors, including coercion, duress and
         harassment;

   –     protection against direct and indirect expropriation, and allowing for adequate
         compensation for any damage incurred in the event of expropriation;

   –     respect for the principle of legality in connection with nationalisations;

18. Reaffirms that with a view to the successful conclusion of the negotiations, quality must
    always prevail over speed;

19. Notes that the investment protection agreement should include clear definitions of the
    investment and investor to be protected, and that purely speculative forms of investment
    should not be protected;

20. Calls for the agreement to be compatible with multilateral obligations under the General
    Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) so as to fulfil the criteria for an economic
    integration agreement;

21. Welcomes the fact that the expected improvement in legal certainty will help SMEs to
    invest abroad, and stresses that SMEs’ voice must be heard during the negotiations
    (including through the involvement of the EU’s new SME Centre in China, the EU’s IPR
    SME Helpdesk and the EU Chamber of Commerce in China), so that the agreement to be
    concluded fosters the internationalisation of those SMEs that are willing to access the other
    party’s market;

22. Stresses that a precondition for the conclusion of the agreement should be the inclusion of a
    strong commitment by the parties to sustainable and inclusive development, in its economic,
    social and environmental dimensions and in relation to investment, in order to build up a
    more balanced trade and investment relationship between the EU and China that is not
    based mainly on low labour costs and poor environmental standards in China;

23. Stresses that investment agreements concluded by the EU must not be in contradiction with
    the fundamental values that the EU wishes to promote through its external policies and must
    not undermine the capacity for public intervention, in particular when pursuing public
    policy objectives such as social and environmental criteria, human rights, the fight against
    counterfeiting, security, workers’ and consumers’ rights, public health and safety, industrial
    policy and cultural diversity; calls for the inclusion of the respective specific and binding
    clauses in the agreement;

24. Requests that in this agreement, as in the case of the other trade commitments into which
    the EU has entered, protecting public services should remain a key principle;

25. Underlines the fact that the future development of the EU-China investment agreement must
    be based on mutual trust and full compliance with WTO obligations; deplores the huge
    levels of public subsidisation of certain sectors with growth potential, including solar

   panels, and calls on the Commission to ensure that the injurious effects of such dumping
   and subsidisation are completely removed in order to speed up the negotiations;

26. Recommends, with regard to market access, that both parties commit to appropriate
    phasing-in periods and transitional arrangements for certain sectors in order to ease the path
    to full or partial liberalisation therein; acknowledges also that both parties may not be able
    to make commitments in certain sectors; calls, in this context, for the exclusion of cultural
    and audiovisual services from the negotiations on market access, in line with the relevant
    provisions of the EU Treaties; stresses the need to address interventionist industrial policies,
    inadequate protection of IPRs, ambiguities in the substance and the application of the rules,
    and other non-tariff and technical barriers to trade;

27. Considers that, since it is difficult to access Chinese markets owing to the preponderance of
    state-run companies, the agreement must, if it is to be balanced, be viewed as a key
    opportunity to establish a level playing-field for both state-run and private-sector
    companies;

28. Stresses the need for the agreement to ensure the EU’s capability to exclude certain strategic
    sectors from Chinese investors;

29. Stresses that the agreement should allow the parties, and in the case of the EU, its individual
    Member States, to define and implement key policies for the promotion and protection of
    cultural diversity;

30. Stresses that the agreement must promote investment which is sustainable and inclusive,
    and respects the environment, particularly in the area of extractive industries, and
    encourages good-quality working conditions in the enterprises targeted by the investment;

31. Calls for a clause stating that an investor shall provide a potential host state party with any
    information that party may require concerning the investment in question, for purposes of
    decision-making in relation to the investment or solely for statistical purposes, while the
    state party shall protect any confidential business information from any disclosure liable to
    prejudice the competitive position of the investor or the investment;

32. Stresses the need for the future agreement to include provisions on the transparency and
    governance of state-run companies and sovereign wealth funds, based on the Santiago
    Principles, which were adopted under the auspices of the IMF and define the principles
    applicable to the governance and institutional structure of sovereign wealth funds and to the
    transparency of their investment strategies;

33. Reiterates its call for an effective corporate social responsibility clause in line with the UN
    Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; affirms that investors should,
    respectively, apply the ILO Tripartite Declaration on Multinational Enterprises and Social
    Policy and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, as well as specific or
    sectoral international standards of responsible practice where these exist; calls for binding
    social and environmental clauses as part of a fully fledged sustainable development chapter
    that is subject to a dispute settlement mechanism; calls on both parties to implement a
    sustainable and inclusive investment strategy that includes a corporate social responsibility
    clause with concrete guidelines for investors, as well as an efficient assessment
    methodology for public authorities overseeing the resulting investments in terms of their
    social and environmental impact;

34. Stresses that the agreement must oblige Chinese investors in the EU to comply with
    European social standards and social dialogue arrangements;

35. Underlines the need for the EU-China bilateral investment agreement to deliver on both
    sustainable growth and job creation, and to foster synergies and positive spill-over effects
    with other regional trade and investment agreements to which the EU or China is a party;

36. Calls on the Commission to complement its impact assessment by also assessing the impact
    of the EU-China investment agreement on human rights, as it has committed to do under the
    Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy;

37. Takes the view that the agreement must include a provision stating that all investors are
    obliged to comply fully with the law of the host party at the local, regional, national and,
    where applicable, supranational level, and that investors failing to respect the rule of law
    shall be subject to civil actions for liability in the judicial process of the relevant jurisdiction
    for any unlawful acts or decisions made in relation to the investment, in particular in cases
    where such acts or decisions lead to significant environmental damage, personal injuries or
    loss of life;

38. Insists that the agreement should include a clause which prohibits the watering-down of
    social and environmental legislation in order to attract investment, and ensures that neither
    party may fail to effectively enforce the relevant legislation through a sustained or recurring
    course of action or inaction, as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition,
    expansion or retention of an investment in its territory;

39. Insists that the EU-China bilateral investment agreement must comply with the EU acquis,
    including the social and environmental legislation in force, and that neither party may fail to
    effectively enforce its legislation in these areas, so that all provisions of this agreement
    encourage the lawful establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention of an investment in
    the respective territory of both parties, and foster best entrepreneurial practices and business
    fair play;

40. Insists on the need for the agreement to require compliance by foreign investors with EU
    data protection standards;

41. Expresses its deep concern regarding the level of discretion of international arbitrators to
    make a broad interpretation of investor protection clauses, thereby leading to the ruling-out
    of legitimate public regulations; demands that the arbitrators appointed by the parties in the
    context of a dispute be independent and impartial, and that the arbitration provided follow a
    code of conduct based on the rules adopted by the UN Commission on International Trade
    Law (UNCITRAL), on those of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
    Disputes (ICSID) or on any other international agreements and standards recognised and
    agreed to by the parties;

42. Considers that the agreement should include, as a key priority, effective state-to-state and
    investor-to-state dispute settlement mechanisms in order, on the one hand, to prevent
    frivolous claims from leading to unjustified arbitration, and, on the other, to ensure that all
    investors have access to a fair trial, followed by enforcement of all arbitration awards
    without delay;

43. Takes the view that the agreement should provide for state-to-state dispute settlement
    procedures and for investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms that are set within a
    suitable legal framework and subject to strict transparency criteria;

44. Calls for the EU and China jointly to establish an early-warning mechanism in order to give
    themselves a chance to solve proactively any incipient dispute on trade or investment at the
    earliest possible stage using all appropriate measures, including soft power and trade
    diplomacy;

45. Considers also that the agreement should include provisions for out-of-court dispute
    settlement in order to foster swift, affordable and amicable dispute resolution between
    parties that freely decide to have recourse to it;

46. Suggests that precise definitions of flexible dispute-settlement mechanisms such as
    mediation be provided in the agreement as regards, for example, the duration, cost and
    implementation of the solutions agreed by the parties;

47. Expresses its view that, once concluded and fully ratified, an EU-China investment
    agreement would replace all existing bilateral investment agreements between individual
    EU Member States and China, in line with Union law;

48. Recommends that negotiations be opened only on condition that formal approval has first
    been given by China’s State Council for market access to be included in the investment
    agreement;

49. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.

Forced abortion scandal in China
European Parliament resolution of 5 July 2012 on the forced abortion scandal in China
(2012/2712(RSP))

The European Parliament,

– having regard to the reports submitted under the Convention on the Elimination of All
  Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Optional Protocol thereto, and
  to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
  Punishment,

– having regard to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,

– having regard to the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held
  in Cairo in 1994,

– having regard to China’s one-child policy and to China’s laws on abortion,

– having regard to Rules 122(5) and 110(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas on 2 June 2012 a seven-months-pregnant woman, Feng Jianmei, was abducted and
   underwent a forced abortion in Zhenping county (Shanxi province), sparking a wave of
   indignation and condemnation in China and around the world;

B. whereas abortions beyond six months are illegal under Chinese law; whereas the Ankang
   municipal government conducted an investigation which concluded that officials in
   Zhenping county had used ‘crude means’ and ‘persuaded’ Ms Feng to abort the foetus;
   whereas the report stated that this decision had violated her rights; whereas the Ankang
   municipal government has announced punishments for local planning officials involved in
   the case, including sacking;

C. whereas, according to the investigation, local officials had asked Ms Feng’s family for a
   ‘guarantee deposit’ of RMB 40 000, which according to her husband was a fine for having a
   second child; whereas local authorities had no legal grounds for collecting such a deposit;
   whereas Ms Feng was forced to sign a consent form to terminate her pregnancy because she
   would not pay the fine, and was kept in the hospital by guards;

D. whereas, as a result of China’s one-child policy, illegal sex-selective abortions are
   widespread, creating an imbalance between the numbers of men and women;

E. whereas the EU has provided, and still provides, funds for organisations involved in family
   planning policies in China;

1. Strongly emphasises that, according to the International Conference on Population and
   Development Plan of Action, the aim of family planning programmes must be to enable
   couples and individuals to make free, responsible and informed decisions about
   childbearing and to make available a full range of safe, effective and acceptable methods of
   family planning of their choice, and any form of coercion has no part to play;

2. Reiterates the fundamental right of all women to access to public health care systems, in
   particular to primary, gynaecological and obstetric health care as defined by the World
   Health Organisation;

3. Extends its condolences to the family of the victims, strongly condemns the harassment to
   which they are being subjected and demands public protection for them;

4. Strongly condemns the decision to force Ms Feng to have an abortion and condemns the
   practice of forced abortions and sterilisations globally, especially in the context of the
   one-child policy;

5. Welcomes the Ankang municipal government’s decision to offer Ms Feng’s family
   compensation and strongly to sanction local officials involved in the case;

6. Takes note of the fact that Ms Feng’s case became widely known thanks to the internet and
   stresses the importance of freedom of expression, including online; welcomes with
   satisfaction the emergence of a public sphere for debate, thanks partly to microblogging;

7. Considers important the ongoing debate among intellectuals and academics as to whether or
   not to continue with the one-child policy in China;

8. Urges the Commission to ensure that its funding of projects does not breach the remarks set
   out in Section III, Title 21 of the general budget of the European Union for the financial
   year 2012;

9. Calls on the Commission and the European External Action Service to include forced
   abortion on the agenda for their next bilateral human rights dialogue with China;

10. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Vice-President of the Commission /
    High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the governments
    and parliaments of the Member States, the Delegation of the European Union to the United
    Nations and the Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of China.

The case of Ai WeiWei in China
European Parliament resolution of 7 April 2011 on the case of Ai Weiwei

The European Parliament,

– having regard to its previous resolutions in the current parliamentary term on human rights
  violations in China,

– having regard to Rule 122(5) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas a wave of calls on the internet for a Chinese 'Jasmine Revolution' (inspired by
   political developments in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya) has resulted in a series of actions and a
   widespread crackdown on human rights activists and dissidents by the Chinese authorities,

B. whereas the internationally renowned artist and critic of the regime, Ai Weiwei, has not
   been seen since he was detained while passing through security checks at Beijing airport on
   Sunday, 3 April 2011,

C. whereas, in addition to his detention, his studio was reportedly raided by the police, who
   confiscated several items,

D. whereas Ai Weiwei was recently prevented from travelling to Oslo for the Nobel Peace
   Prize ceremony and held under house arrest after the opening of his sunflower seeds exhibit
   in London, and his studio in Shanghai was ransacked,

E. whereas Ai Weiwei is widely known outside China, but is prevented from exhibiting as an
   artist in China, although his work has become known a result of his co-design of the 'Bird's
   Nest' Olympic stadium,

F. whereas Ai Weiwei achieved national and international prominence by publishing the
   names of the child victims of the Sichuan earthquake and was subsequently beaten up by
   persons unknown, leading to his hospitalisation in Germany,

G. whereas Ai Weiwei is one of the most prominent signatories of Charter 08, a petition that
   urges China to press ahead with political reform and the protection of human rights,

1. Condemns the unjustifiable and unacceptable detention of the critic of the regime and
   internationally renowned artist, Ai Weiwei;

2. Calls for Ai Weiwei's immediate and unconditional release and expresses its solidarity with
   his peaceful actions and initiatives in favour of democratic reforms and the protection of
   human rights;

3. Emphasises that the police have refused to provide the wife of Ai Weiwei with information
   regarding the reason for his detention;

4. Stresses that Ai Weiwei's detention is characteristic of the widespread recent crackdown on
   human rights activists and dissidents in China, with numerous arrests, excessive prison

   sentences, increased personal surveillance and increased repressive restrictions on foreign
   reporters;

5. Calls on the VP/HR, Catherine Ashton, to continue to raise the issue of human rights
   violations at the very highest level in her contacts with the Chinese authorities, - including
   the recent sentencing of Liu Xianbin to 10 years and Liu Xiaobo to 11 years as well as, for
   example, the cases of Liu Xia, Chen Guangcheng, Gao Zhisheng, Liu Xianbin, Hu Jia, Tang
   Jitian, Jiang Tianyong, Teng Biao, Liu Shihui, Tang Jingling, Li Tiantian, Ran Yunfei, Ding
   Mao and Chen Wei, noting also with concern the repressive conditions under which their
   spouses and families are living - and report back on those cases to the European Parliament
   after the upcoming high-level political dialogue between the EU and China, which the
   VP/HR will participate in;

6. Notes that China's human rights record remains a matter for serious concern; emphasises the
   need to make a comprehensive assessment of the EU-China human rights dialogue,
   including the EU-China legal seminar on human rights, in order to judge the methodology
   applied and the progress achieved;

7. Calls on its Delegation for Relations with the People's Republic of China to raise and
   thoroughly address the question of human rights violations with regard, in particular, to the
   cases listed in this resolution at the next inter-parliamentary meeting;

8. Calls on the VP/HR to rethink that dialogue in order to make it effective and result-oriented,
   and to take all necessary steps for the swift organisation of the next human rights dialogue,
   in the course of which those cases and other human rights violations referred to in the
   European Parliament's resolutions will be raised;

9. Recalls that China has been under a single party since 1949, and in this context of recent
   political development, and in view of the deteriorating human rights situation in China,
   states that political parties in the EU should reconsider their relationships;

10. Takes the view that the development of EU-China relations must go hand in hand with the
    development of a genuine, fruitful and effective political dialogue and that respect for
    human rights should be an integral part of the new framework agreement which is now
    being negotiated with China;

11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the VP/HR, the President-in-Office of the
    Council of the European Union, the Commission, and the President, Prime Minister and
    People’s National Assembly of the People’s Republic of China.

Situation and cultural heritage in Kashgar (Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous
Region, China)
European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2011 on the situation and cultural heritage
in Kashgar (Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China)

The European Parliament,

– having regard to previous resolutions on China, notably those concerning human rights and
  minority rights, and in particular those of 26 November 20091 and 25 November 20102,

– having regard to the 13th EU-China Summit of 6 October 2010, held in Brussels, which
  included the first EU-China High-Level Cultural Forum aimed at strengthening EU-China
  cultural dialogue and cooperation,

– having regard to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or
  Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, adopted by General Assembly resolution
  47/135 of 18 December 1992, which stipulates that ‘[s]tates shall protect the existence and
  the national or ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic identity of minorities within their
  respective territories’,

– having regard to Articles 4, 22 and 119 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of
  China, which provide for, respectively, governmental assistance in the cultural development
  of regions inhabited by minority nationalities, state protection of valuable cultural
  monuments and relics, and the protection of the cultural legacy of the nationalities,

– having regard to Rule 122(5) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas in 2009 the Chinese Government announced a USD 500 million 'Kashgar
   Dangerous House Reform' programme of urban reconstruction, which, since 2009, has been
   progressively destroying the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar, the plan beíng to demolish
   85% of the traditional Old City, replace it with modern apartment blocks, and convert the
   remaining old parts of the city into mixed Sino-Uyghur tourist sites,

B. whereas Beijing continues to exclude the city of Kashgar from bids for United Nations
   Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) world heritage status, such as
   the planned transnational application to achieve protection of several cultural sites on
   Central Asia’s Silk Road,

C. whereas the city of Kashgar is an internationally significant site of unique architectural
   heritage with historical and geographical importance as an ancient centre of trade and
   tourism,

D. whereas the city of Kashgar retains highly symbolic value for the cultural identity of the
   region’s Uyghur and Hui populations, as well as for China’s cultural diversity,

E. whereas the reconstruction programme’s official justification of earthquake fortification
   does not necessitate complete demolition of traditional buildings, one other option being
   culturally sensitive renovation,

F. whereas Beijing has engaged in destructive housing modernisation in other parts of China
   through its various local 'development plans', demolishing historic buildings and forcibly
   resettling residents without considering the loss of priceless historical and cultural heritage
   and without giving priority to the preservation - in protected areas or in museums - of relics
   or principal building artefacts and architecture in order to pass on to future generations, and
   to the world, objects illustrating the thousands of years of Chinese historical and cultural
   development,

G. whereas Beijing is continuously implementing repressive ethnocultural policies in the
   Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), which reached a grim peak during the
   violent crackdown on Uyghur protesters in 2009’s Urumqi unrest,

H. whereas the Uyghur and Hui population suffer ongoing violations of their human rights and
   whereas many are denied adequate political representation and cultural self-determination,

1. Calls on the Chinese Government to immediately stop the cultural destruction threatening
   Kashgar’s architectural survival and to carry out a comprehensive expert inquiry into
   culture-sensitive methods of renovation;

2. Calls on the Chinese Government to end all forced resettlement and social marginalisation
   of Kashgar’s Uyghur population, which is being caused by the destruction of residential
   areas, and to adequately compensate all previous victims for the losses suffered;

3. Calls on the Chinese authorities to make every effort to develop a genuine Han-Uyghur
   dialogue, to adopt more inclusive and comprehensive economic policies in Xinjiang aimed
   at strengthening local ownership, and to protect the cultural identity of the Uyghur
   population;

4. Urges the Chinese Government to adhere to its constitutional obligations by adequately
   supporting Kashgar's and XUAR's cultural traditions, which are strongly influenced by the
   Uyghur identity;

5. Calls on the Chinese authorities to take more measures to prevent illegal trade and
   smuggling activities, which contribute to the loss of Chinese civilisations' heritage;

6. Calls on the Chinese Minister of Culture to review the existing regulation and law on the
   protection of cultural relics in order to adapt the current changing lifestyle of the minority
   ethnic group which sometimes, unaware of its treasures, makes inappropriate use or
   declines protection of its cultural heritage; states that an educational campaign at national
   level on this issue should be promoted;

7. Urges the Chinese Government to assess the possibility of including the city of Kashgar in
   the joint application with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan for the Silk
   Road's UNESCO world heritage designation;

8. Calls on the Chinese Government to stop all discriminatory and repressive policies towards
   the Uyghur and Hui populations, and to respect their fundamental right to freedom of

   cultural expression, having regard in particular to Tursunjan Hezim, a former history
   teacher, who, after a secret trial, has been sentenced to seven years in jail, and also other
   activists who have been sentenced in recent months;

9. Calls on the European External Action Service to devise additional measures in the context
   of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights in order to protect the human
   and cultural rights of China’s ethnic, religious and linguistic minority groups;

10. Calls on EU representatives and the Vice-President of the Commission / High
    Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to increase and
    intensify talks on human rights and minority rights with the People’s Republic of China,
    and to make the human rights dialogue more effective and results-oriented;

11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Vice-President of the Commission /
    High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the governments
    and parliaments of the Member States, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the
    United Nations Human Rights Council, UNESCO, the National People’s Congress (and its
    Standing Committee) of the People's Republic of China and the XUAR Regional Party

Tibet - plans to make Chinese the main language of instruction
European Parliament resolution of 25 November 2010 on Tibet – plans to make Chinese
the main language of instruction


The European Parliament,

– having regard to its previous resolutions on China and Tibet, in particular its resolution of
  10 April 2008 on Tibet1,

– having regard to Rule 122(5) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas respect for human rights and freedom of identity, culture and religion is a founding
   principle of the European Union and a priority of its foreign policy,

B. whereas the People’s Republic of China has expressed a desire for harmonious ethnic
   relations among all 56 ethnic minorities,

C. whereas on 19 October 2010 approximately 1 000 ethnic Tibetan students marched through
   Tongren, also known as Rebkong, peacefully opposing a plan to establish Mandarin
   Chinese as the main language of instruction in schools in the region; whereas on 23 October
   2010 the protest spread to Qingai province and Beijing, where 400 Tibetan students
   studying at Minsu university staged a demonstration,

D. whereas the Tibetan language, as one of Asia’s four oldest and most original languages, is a
   fundamental catalyst for Tibetan identity, culture and religion, but also, together with
   Tibetan culture as a whole, constitutes an irreplaceable part of the world’s heritage; whereas
   the Tibetan language, the testimony to a historically rich civilisation, is a fundamental and
   irreplaceable element of Tibetan identity, culture and religion,

E. whereas languages express the social and cultural attitudes of a community, whereas the
   shared language of a community is a key determinant of culture, and whereas languages
   convey very specific social and cultural behaviours and ways of thinking,

F. whereas it has been established that mother-tongue bilingual education is the most effective
   path to successful bilingualism for Tibetans, and whereas this ‘model 1 bilingual education
   policy’ has consistently led to the highest college placement rates for Tibetan high school
   students across the Tibetan region,

G. whereas in elementary, middle and high schools in all areas covered by the Tibet
   Autonomous Regional government, the Tibetan language is gradually being replaced by
   Chinese, and official documents are usually unavailable in Tibetan,

H. whereas changes to education policy would limit the use of the Tibetan language in schools,
   since all textbooks and subjects, except for Tibetan and English language classes, would be
   in Mandarin Chinese,

1
    OJ C 247 E, 15.10.2009, p. 5.

I. whereas the People’s Republic of China, along with 142 other countries, voted to adopt the
   United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples on 13 September 2007,
   Article 14 of which states that ‘indigenous peoples have the right to establish and control
   their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own languages, in a
   manner appropriate to their cultural methods of teaching and learning’,

J. whereas, owing to the dominance of the Chinese language, there is growing anxiety over
   job prospects among graduate students in Tibetan areas as, according to the petition signed
   by teachers and students, most Tibetan students have never been in a Chinese-language
   environment and therefore are not able to communicate in Chinese,

1. Condemns the increased crackdown on the exercise of the cultural, linguistic, religious and
   other fundamental freedoms of Tibetans, and stresses the need to preserve and protect the
   distinct cultural, religious and national identity of the six million Tibetan people and to
   address concerns about the repression and marginalisation of the Tibetan language, which
   underpins Tibetan identity;

2. Notes the concerns about the attempts to devalue the Tibetan language, and stresses the fact
   that if there is to be successful bilingual education, Tibetan must be the domestic language;

3. Calls on the Chinese authorities to implement Article 4 of the Constitution of the People’s
   Republic of China’s and Article 10 of the Law on Regional National autonomy which
   guarantee ‘the freedom of all nationalities to use and develop their own spoken and written
   languages’;

4. Urges the Chinese authorities to support a genuine policy of bilingualism, whereby all
   subjects, including maths and science, are allowed to be taught in the Tibetan language,
   teaching of the Chinese language is strengthened, and local authorities and communities are
   empowered to make decisions on the language of instruction;

5. Considers that every ethnic minority has the right to preserve its own language and writings;
   takes the view that a fair bilingual education system will contribute to better cooperation
   and understanding when Tibetan people learn Chinese, with Han people living in Tibetan
   areas at the same time being encouraged to learn the Tibetan language;

6. Stresses that, with the introduction of Chinese as the primary language of instruction, the
   quality of education for the vast majority of middle-school Tibetan students would suffer
   significantly, and that school subjects should therefore, as is most appropriate, only be
   taught in the Tibetan mother tongue;

7. Calls on the Chinese authorities to make every effort to lessen the linguistic and cultural
   disadvantages faced by Tibetans in urban employment, albeit in ways that do not undermine
   Tibetan language and culture;

8. Calls on the European Commission, the HR/VP and the Member States to urge the Chinese
   Government to ensure, firstly, that the right of peaceful expression by students is respected
   and that the relevant authorities address their grievances substantively and appropriately,
   and, secondly, that the 2002 ‘Regulations on the Study, Use and Development of the
   Tibetan Language’ are properly implemented, in accordance with the Law of Regional
   Ethnic Autonomy;

9. Asks the Commission to report on the use of the fund requested for the support of Tibetan
   civil society in China and in exile in the framework of the 2009 budget (EUR 1 million),
   and stresses the need to preserve Tibetan culture, particularly in exile;

10. Calls once again on China to ratify the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights,
    and deplores the often discriminatory treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in China;

11. Asks the Chinese authorities to provide foreign media access to Tibet, including the Tibetan
    areas outside the Tibet Autonomous Region, and to abolish the system of special permits
    being required;

12. Calls on EU diplomatic representatives in Beijing to visit the region and to report back to
    the Council and the HR/VP on the current situation with regard to the education and
    language issue;

13. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
    Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs
    and Security Policy, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the
    Government and Parliament of the People’s Republic of China, and His Holiness the Dalai
    Lama.

   undisclosed location in Beijing,

B. whereas Liu Xiaobo was arrested on 23 June 2009 and charged the following day with
   ‘inciting subversion of state power’, pursuant to Article 105 of the Criminal Code,

   constitutional reform, democratisation and protection of human rights, which was
   subsequently signed by more than 10 000 Chinese citizens,

D. whereas on 25 December 2009 the Beijing Municipal No 1 Intermediate People’s Court
   found Liu Xiaobo guilty of ‘inciting subversion of state power’ and sentenced him to
   11 years in prison, and whereas the government based this conviction on Mr Liu’s role in
   drafting and organising the signing of Charter 2008 and on six essays criticising the Chinese
   Government, published between 2005 and 2007,

E. whereas Liu Xiaobo’s wife and staff from about a dozen foreign embassies in Beijing
   requested permission to observe the trial but were denied access to the courtroom,

   treatment while in detention of Qi Choghuai, a reporter and former Shandong Bureau Chief
   for the Fazhi Morning Post,

K. whereas, ahead of the country’s 60th anniversary on 1 October, the Chinese authorities
   increased their surveillance, harassment and imprisonment of activists in order to prevent
   them from raising human rights concerns, and whereas, according to Amnesty International,
   several hundred activists and dissidents were placed under various kinds of surveillance or
   house arrest on that occasion,

L. whereas in April 2009 the People’s Republic of China submitted a document to the United
   Nations in support of its candidacy for membership of the Human Rights Council, in which
   it affirmed that the People’s Republic of China was ‘committed to the promotion and
   protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Chinese people’,

M. whereas on 13 January 2010 Google announced its intention to stop cooperating with
   Chinese internet censorship, linking this to sophisticated cyber-attacks on its computer
   systems (which it suspected originated in China), aimed in part at the Gmail user accounts
   of human rights activists,

N. whereas the EU is China’s biggest trading partner and investor, while China is the EU’s
   second biggest trading partner, and whereas trade and economic relations have
   overshadowed the questions of democratic reforms, respect for human rights and the rule of
   law,

O. whereas the EU-China human rights dialogue established in 2000 has achieved negligible
   results so far, and whereas this lack of results is also the consequence of an uncoordinated

4. Urges the People’s Republic of China to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental
   freedoms and calls for ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political

The European Parliament,

– having regard to its previous resolutions of 1 February 20071 and 27 September 20072 on a
  universal moratorium on the death penalty,

– having regard to the UN General Assembly resolutions of 18 December 2007

  Uighur ethnicity following the riots of 5-7 July 2009 in Urumqi in the Xinjiang Uighur
  Autonomous Region (XUAR),

– having regard to Articles 35, 36 and 37 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of
  China, which provide, respectively, that all citizens shall enjoy freedom of expression and
  freedom of religious belief, and deem the freedom of the person to be 'inviolable',

– having regard to its previous resolutions on China and, in particular, to its resolution of
  13 December 2007 on the EU-China Summit and the EU-China human rights dialogue3,

– having regard to the EU-China seminar of 18-19 November 2009 and the 28th round of the

– having regard to Rule 122(5) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas the Union is based on adherence to the values of freedom, democracy and
   observance of human rights and to the rule of law, and it regards observance of those
   inalienable rights as an essential prerequisite for peaceful existence in a society,

B. whereas the new EU-China Strategic Partnership, currently being negotiated, is very
   important for relations between the Union and China in the future, and whereas a true
   partnership must be based on shared common values,

3
    OJ C 323 E, 18.12.2008, p. 489.

C. whereas, on 8 May 2009, the Union called for commutation of the death sentences handed
   down by Lhasa Intermediate People's Court to several Tibetans following the Lhasa riots in
   March 2008,

D. whereas, during the first days of July 2009, the worst ethnic violence in decades broke out
   in XUAR after Uighur demonstrators took to the streets and attacked Han Chinese in
   Urumqi, causing casualties among them, in protest against attacks on Uighur workers at a
   factory in South China in June 2009; whereas, according to official figures, 197 people died
   and more than 1600 people were wounded,

E. whereas, in order to ensure that Tibetans and Uighurs, China's two major ethnic minorities,
   can coexist peacefully with the great majority of the Chinese population, who are of Han
   ethnicity, it is essential to begin a frank, ongoing and mutually respectful dialogue,

F. whereas there is growing dissatisfaction and resentment among the Uighur population –
   which is largely Muslim, shares linguistic and cultural bonds with Central Asia and
   accounts for almost half of Xinjiang's 20 million people – directed at the mainly Han
   Chinese authorities, the latter being accused of closely watching and containing religious
   activities in a context of employment discrimination and marginalisation of their own ethnic
   group in the region; whereas the call by human rights NGOs for the international
   community to send an independent investigative team to the site of the riots received no
   response,

G. whereas the People’s Republic of China has expressed a desire for harmonious ethnic
   relations in XUAR,

H. whereas the legitimacy of the sentences passed on the Tibetans condemned for crimes
   during the March 2008 riots has been called into question in a report by Human Rights
   Watch, which states that some trial proceedings took place covertly on undisclosed dates
   and that the Tibetans were denied access to a meaningful defence with lawyers of their
   choosing,

I. whereas religious observance in China is subject to restrictions and is closely controlled by
   the State,

J. whereas the death penalty is applicable in the case of 68 offences in China, including non-
   violent offences such as tax fraud and drugs offences,

1. Reiterates its long-standing opposition to the death penalty in all cases and under all
   circumstances; recalls the EU's strong commitment to working towards abolition of the
   death penalty everywhere and emphasises once again that abolition of the death penalty
   contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of
   human rights;

2. Recognises the positive move by the Supreme People's Court, in January 2007, to review
   death sentences but deplores the fact that it has not led to a significant decrease in the
   number of executions in China; remains concerned that China still carries out the greatest
   number of executions worldwide;

3. Urges the Chinese Government, therefore, to adopt a moratorium on the death penalty
   immediately and unconditionally, this being seen as a crucial step towards abolition of the

   death penalty; strongly condemns the execution of the two Tibetans, Lobsang Gyaltsen and
   Loyak, and of the nine persons of Uighur ethnicity following, respectively, the events in
   March 2008 in Lhasa and the riots of 5-7 July 2009 in Urumqi; calls on the Chinese
   authorities to suspend all the other death sentences passed by the Intermediate People's
   Courts of Lhasa and Urumqi and to commute those sentences, in the case of persons duly
   found guilty of acts of violence, to terms of imprisonment; condemns, too, the death
   sentences with two years' suspension imposed on Tenzin Phuntsok and Kangtsuk, following
   the March protests, and the imprisonment for life of Dawa Sangpo, and underlines its
   concern as to whether they received a fair trial;

4. Calls once again on China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
   deplores the often discriminatory treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in China;

5. Highlights the fact that the Chinese Government published its first National Human Rights
   Action Plan (2009-2010) in April 2009, aiming in particular to improve the protection of
   citizens’ rights throughout the law-enforcement and judicial processes, eliminate arbitrary
   detention, prohibit the extortion of confessions by torture and ensure fair and open trials;
   calls on the Chinese authorities to make public the number of executions carried out;

6. Calls on the Chinese authorities to make every effort to develop a genuine Han-Uighur
   dialogue, to adopt more inclusive and comprehensive economic policies in Xinjiang aimed
   at strengthening local ownership, and to protect the cultural identity of the Uighur
   population;

7. Stresses that China's human rights record remains a matter of serious concern; insists on the
   need for rigorous follow-up between all rounds of the EU-China human rights dialogue,
   with a view to ensuring the application of the recommendations resulting from previous
   dialogues, which were mutually agreed by both parties, and in the form of the EU-China
   legal seminars on human rights which used to precede the rounds of the dialogue and which
   involved academic and civil-society representatives; calls on the Council and the
   Commission to put the questions of abolition of the death penalty and observance of ethnic
   minorities' and religious rights on the agenda for the 12th EU-China Summit on
   30 November 2009, and to continue to pursue inclusion in the new Partnership and
   Cooperation Agreement, currently in negotiation, of a clause concerning respect for human
   rights in China;

8. Calls on the Chinese authorities to end immediately the ‘Strike Hard’ campaign, under
   which the rights of the people in XUAR are being repressed, while the causes of unrest are
   being ignored;

9. Calls for the reopening of sincere and results-orientated dialogue between the Chinese
   Government and the Dalai Lama's representatives, based on the 'Memorandum on Genuine
   Autonomy for the Tibetan People' and leading towards a positive, substantial and
   meaningful change in Tibet consistent with the principles outlined in the Constitution and
   laws of the People's Republic of China;

10. Reiterates its solidarity with all the victims of the events in Urumqi, XUAR, in July 2009,
    while recognising the duty of the State institutions to maintain public order; is concerned at
    reports alleging that disproportionate force was used against ethnic Uighurs and that large
    numbers of them were detained;

11. Calls on the Chinese authorities to ensure that those detained in connection with the above
    events are guaranteed humane treatment while in custody and fair trials in accordance with
    international law, including access to a lawyer of their choosing, presumption of innocence
    and proportionate sentencing of those found guilty;

12. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
    Governments of the Member States, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Human
    Rights Council and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

   representatives of the Chinese Government have produced no breakthrough and no further
   talks are planned,

C. whereas the Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan People, produced at the
   request of the Chinese Government and presented by envoys of His Holiness the Dalai
   Lama at the eighth round of talks in November 2008 in Beijing, respects the principles
   underpinning the Chinese Constitution and the territorial integrity of the People’s Republic
   of China, but was rejected by the Chinese Government as an attempt at 'semi-independence'
   and 'independence in disguise',

D. whereas His Holiness the Dalai Lama has appealed for non-violence, was awarded the
   Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his efforts and is not calling for the independence of Tibet
   but for the resumption of negotiations with the Chinese authorities, so as to reach a
   comprehensive political agreement on genuine autonomy, within the context of the People’s
   Republic of China,

E. whereas over the last few days the Chinese authorities have tightened security in Tibet, with
   journalists and foreigners being banned from visiting the region and permits already issued
   to foreigners cancelled, implementing a 'strike hard' campaign against the Tibetan people,

F. whereas a large number of monks of the monastery of An Tuo, in the Chinese province of

   Tibetan New Year,

1. Urges the Chinese Government to consider the Memorandum for Genuine Autonomy for
   the Tibetan People of November 2008 as a basis for substantive discussion leading towards
   positive, meaningful change in Tibet, consistent with the principles outlined in the
   Constitution and laws of the People’s Republic of China;

2. Calls on the Council to ascertain what exactly happened during the negotiations between the
   People's Republic of China and the envoys of His Holiness the Dalai Lama;

3. Calls on the Council Presidency, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the exile of His
   Holiness the Dalai Lama to India, to adopt a declaration calling on the Chinese Government
   to open a constructive dialogue with a view to reaching a comprehensive political
   agreement and to include a reference to the Memorandum for Genuine Autonomy for the
   Tibetan People;

4. Condemns all acts of violence, whether they are the work of demonstrators or
   disproportionate repression by the forces of law and order;

5. Calls on the Chinese Government to release immediately and unconditionally all those
   detained solely for engaging in peaceful protest, and to account for all those who have been
   killed or gone missing, and all those detained and the nature of the charges against them;

6. Asks the Chinese authorities to provide foreign media access to Tibet, including the Tibetan
   areas outside the Tibet Autonomous Region, and to abolish the system of special permits
   required for access to the Tibet Autonomous Region;

7. Urges the Chinese authorities to grant UN human rights experts and recognised
   international non-governmental organisations unimpeded access to Tibet so that they can
   investigate the situation there;

8. Urges the Council Presidency to take the initiative of including the question of Tibet on the
   agenda for a meeting of the General Affairs Council with a view to discussing how the EU
   could facilitate progress on a solution for Tibet;

earthquake and before the Olympic Games


The European Parliament,

– having regard to its resolution of 22 May 2008 on the natural disaster in China1,

– having regard to its resolution of 10 April 2008 on Tibet2,

– having regard to its resolution of 13 December 2007 on the EU-China Summit and the
  EU-China human rights dialogue3,

– having regard to the outcome of the 25th round of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue in
  Brdo, Slovenia, on 15 May 2008,

– having regard to Rule 103(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas both China and the EU are committed to contributing to peace, security and
   sustainable development in the world,

B. having regard to the scale of the destruction wrought by the violent earthquake in South-
   west China on 12 May 2008; whereas that earthquake claimed tens of thousands of victims,
   in particular in Sichuan province; whereas, according to the latest estimate, 10 million
   people were affected by the earthquake and almost 70 000 killed, including thousands of
   schoolchildren who died when their classrooms collapsed,

C. whereas the Chinese Government took exceptional emergency measures, deploying
   personnel – including part of the army – and medical teams to aid the inhabitants of the
   stricken region,

D. having regard to the extraordinary mobilisation and solidarity of the entire Chinese people
   and of the international community in efforts to aid the victims of the disaster,

E. whereas the opening of Tibet to tourists and the media should not be used as a ‘public
   relations event’ but as a real opening, which will allow journalists, the media and tourists to
   visit the region of Tibet,

F. having regard to the concluding statements of the International Olympic Committee (IOC),
   which underlined that granting the 2008 Olympic Games to China would help to open up
   the country and improve the human rights situation,

1. Expresses satisfaction at the developments in EU-China relations, the sectoral dialogues and

    Texts adopted, P6_TA(2008)0119.

   the closer cooperation on various globalised issues;

2. Calls on the Chinese authorities to bear in mind that earthquake warnings constitute one
   benchmark of the development of a country; stresses, therefore, the vital importance of
   responding actively and promptly to any warning that the scientific community can give the
   authorities in the unlikely but possible situation of another natural disaster in China;

3. Welcomes the resumption of contacts, after the events of March 2008 in Lhasa, between the
   representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities; encourages the two parties to
   intensify these contacts so as to establish the bases for mutual trust, without which it will be
   impossible to arrive at a mutually acceptable political solution;

4. Regrets that while there has been major progress in relations with China as regards trade
   and economics, that progress has not been accompanied by substantial achievements as
   regards issues relating to human rights and democracy;

5. Deplores the fact that China’s human rights record remains a matter of concern owing to
   widespread and systematic human rights abuses; recalls the commitments to human rights
   made by China when the country won its bid to host the Olympic Games;

6. Condemns China’s frequent use of the death penalty and calls on the Chinese authorities to
   establish a moratorium on executions;

7. Deplores the fact that no international calls have succeed in stopping the Chinese authorities
   from pursuing their follow-up to the riots of 14 March 2008 in Tibet, with participants in
   the protest in Lhasa still being traced, detained and arbitrarily arrested, and their families
   being given no information as to their whereabouts, although this is required by Chinese
   law; calls on the Chinese authorities to halt its ‘patriotic re-education’ campaign, which has
   been intensified since the beginning of April, during the Olympic Games in the name of the
   long-established ‘Olympic Truce’;

8. Notes with satisfaction that China rapidly agreed to accept the assistance of the international
   community in helping the victims of the earthquake in the Sichuan region and facilitating
   the operation of voluntary humanitarian aid organisations in distributing aid;

9. Stresses the importance of the support of the European Union, of its Member States and of
   the international community for the reconstruction phase in the affected region;

10. Calls on China to abide by the public commitments which it made with regard to human
    rights and minority rights, democracy and the rule of law and which the IOC announced
    when it decided to allow China to organise the Olympic Games;

11. Urges the Chinese authorities to take this historic opportunity to demonstrate to the world
    that the granting of the Olympic Games to Beijing has provided a unique chance to improve
    their human rights record by displaying clemency to all political prisoners and human rights
    activists in gaol, including those in gaol in Tibet following the uprising of March 2008
    (except, of course, for perpetrators of violent crimes); calls, moreover, on the Chinese
    authorities to stop discrimination against rural migrants and ethnic minorities and to refrain
    from harassing trade-union activists, lawyers and journalists when they denounce violations
    of fundamental freedoms; reiterates its conviction that the imprisonment of such people is
    against the universal and accepted spirit of the ius gentium (law of nations);

12. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
    governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Government of the People’s
    Republic of China and the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee.

      financial aid for the accomplishment of the commitments;

Arrest of Chinese dissident Hu Jia
European Parliament resolution of 17 January 2008 on the arrest of the Chinese dissident
Hu Jia


The European Parliament,

–    having regard to its previous resolutions on the human rights situation in China,

–    having regard to the two latest rounds of the EU-China Dialogue on Human Rights held
     in Beijing on 17 October 2007, and in Berlin on 15 and 16 May 2007,

–    having regard to the public hearing held on 26 November 2007 by its Subcommittee on
     Human Rights concerning Human Rights in China in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic
     Games in Beijing,

–    having regard to the Olympic Truce called for by the UN General Assembly on 31
     October 2007, when it urged UN Member States to observe and promote peace during the
     2008 Olympic Games,

–    having regard to Rule 115(5) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas the human rights campaigner Hu Jia was taken away from his home in Beijing by
     police officers on 27 December 2007 on charges of inciting subversion,

B.   whereas Hu Jia and his wife, Zeng Jinyan, have thrown the spotlight on human rights
     abuses in China over the past few years and spent many periods under house arrest as a
     result of their campaigning,

C.   whereas Hu Jia is in bad health, suffering from a liver disease for which he must take
     medication,

D.   whereas in 2006 Time Magazine named Zeng Jinyan one of the world's one hundred
     heroes and pioneers and in 2007, together with Hu Jia, she received the Reporters without
     Borders special 'China' prize, and was nominated for the Sakharov Prize,

E.   whereas human rights organisations called the arrest another move by the Chinese
     authorities to silence critics ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games,

F.   whereas 57 intellectuals from China immediately published an open letter calling for the
     instant release of Hu Jia,

G.   whereas the President of the European Parliament published a statement on 31 December
     2007 admonishing the Chinese authorities for their detention of Hu Jia, and urged them to
     use the 2008 Olympic Games as 'an opportunity for China to demonstrate that a country
     hosting the world’s most important sports event is committed to internationally-
     recognised human rights standards, including freedom of expression',

1.    Strongly condemns the detention of Hu Jia and demands his prompt release and that of all
      dissidents who have been arrested and jailed for crimes of opinion;

2.    Urges the Chinese authorities to guarantee in all circumstances the physical and
      psychological integrity of Mr Hu Jia, his relatives and his lawyers;

3.    Calls upon China to respect its commitments to human rights and the rule of law, in
      particular the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by
      the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1998, by putting an end to
      the harassment of Chinese human rights defenders, in order to demonstrate its
      commitment to human rights in its Olympic year;

4.    Urges China not to use the 2008 Olympic Games as a pretext to arrest and illegally detain
      and imprison dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists who either report on, or
      demonstrate against, human rights abuses;

5.    Reiterates its opinion that human rights concerns should receive far more attention in the
      build-up to the 2008 Olympic Games, and highlights the need for respect for universal
      fundamental ethical principles and the promotion of a peaceful society concerned with the
      preservation of human dignity, as enshrined in Articles 1 and 2 of the Olympic Charter;

6.    Urges China to reform its criminal law to allow greater freedom of expression to
      journalists, writers, freelancers, reporters etc., who will report to the world on such an
      important event as the 2008 Olympic Games; considers that such reform will also make it
      possible to clarify the scope of certain unclear legal provisions (e.g. Article 105 of China's
      Criminal Code), and give the world a positive signal that the Seventeenth National
      Congress of the Chinese Communist Party paved the way for greater respect for different
      opinions;

7.    Calls on the Chinese authorities to allow Hu Jia and all the other dissidents under arrest to
      receive medical assistance if necessary, and to bear in mind that detention in
      inappropriate conditions could damage their health;

8.    Urges the Chinese authorities to close the so-called 'black jails', places of detention set up
      to detain 'troublemakers' in advance of the 2008 Olympic Games;

9.    Calls on the Council of the European Union to take action in relation to the Chinese
      authorities regarding the arrest of Hu Jia and the disappearance on 22 September 2007 of
      Gao Zhisheng, a noted human rights lawyer and friend of Hu Jia, who has come to
      represent the plight of the many thousands of human rights defenders currently
      imprisoned in China;

10.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      governments and parliaments of the Member States and the candidate countries, the
      President and Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China, and the International
      Olympic Committee.

EU-China Summit - EU/China human rights dialogue
European Parliament resolution of 13 December 2007 on the EU-China Summit and the
EU/China human rights dialogue

The European Parliament,

–    having regard to the Joint Statement of the 10th China-EU Summit held in Beijing on 28
     November 2007,

–    having regard to the public hearing held on 26 November 2007 by its Subcommittee on
     Human Rights on 'Human Rights in China in the run-up to the Olympics',

–    having regard to the rounds of the EU-China Dialogue on Human Rights held in Beijing
     on 17 October 2007 and in Berlin on 15-16 May 2007,

–    having regard to its resolution of 6 September 2007 on the functioning of the human
     rights dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries1,

–    having regard to its resolution of 15 February 2007 on the dialogue between the Chinese
     government and the envoys of the Dalai Lama2,

–    having regard to its resolution of 7 September 2006 on EU-China relations3 and to its
     previous resolutions on China,

–    having regard to the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Dialogues, adopted on
     13 December 2001, and to the evaluation of the implementation of these guidelines,
     adopted on 9 December 2004,

–    having regard to its previous annual resolutions on human rights in the world,

–    having regard to the UN Olympics Truce, as passed by the UN General Assembly on
     31 October 2007 (A/RES/62/4), inviting UN member states to observe and promote peace
     during the Olympic Games,

–    having regard to the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

–    having regard to Rule 103(4) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas since the setting-up of the EU-China Summit mechanism in 1998, China-EU
     relations have developed strongly, both politically and economically,

B.   whereas any decision to initiate a human rights dialogue is taken on the basis of certain
     criteria adopted by the Council, which notably take into consideration the major concerns
     on the part of the EU about the human rights situation in the country concerned, a genuine

2
  Texts adopted, P6_TA(2007)0055.

     commitment on the part of the authorities of the country concerned, with regard to such
     dialogue, to improving the human rights situation on the ground, and the positive impact
     which a human rights dialogue may have on the human rights situation,

C.   whereas the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games should constitute an ideal opportunity for
     focusing world attention on the human rights situation in China,

D.   whereas the EU is based upon and defined by its adherence to the principles of freedom,
     democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law;
     whereas the EU considers that adherence to these principles constitutes the prerequisite
     for peace and stability in any society,

E.   whereas the EU-China strategic partnership is of great importance for relations between
     the EU and China and whereas a genuine partnership must be based on shared common
     values,

F.   whereas the strengthening and deepening of EU-China relations could help to develop
     convergent views regarding actions to tackle global challenges such as climate change,
     security, terrorism and non-proliferation of arms,

G.   whereas there are continually disturbing reports of political repression, particularly of
     journalists, human rights activists and members of religious and ethnic minorities,
     allegations of torture, widespread use of forced labour, frequent use of the death penalty
     and systematic repression of freedom of religion, speech and the media including the
     Internet, and the strict controls exercised by the Chinese Government over information
     about and access to the Tibetan areas of China; whereas it is therefore difficult to
     determine accurately the scope of human rights abuses,

H.   whereas China's engagement and influence in the world have increased considerably over
     the last decade; whereas credibility, democratic values and responsibility should
     constitute the fundamental basis of the relationship between the EU and China,

EU-China Summit

1.   Welcomes the Joint Statement of the 10th EU-China Summit in which both sides reaffirm
     their commitment to developing a comprehensive strategic partnership to meet global
     challenges, as well as the further development of EU-China relations and their closer
     cooperation in order to deal with a wide range of issues;

2.   Regrets the fact that once again the Council and Commission have failed to raise in a firm
     manner human rights issues at the EU-China Summit in order to give more political
     weight to human rights concerns, and that the EU did not take the opportunity of the
     approach of the Olympics to address serious human rights concerns in China;

3.   Calls on China and the EU to ensure a more balanced trade and economic partnership
     which should lead to sustainable growth and social development, in particular in the areas
     of climate change, environment and energy;

4.   Considers that the pirating and counterfeiting of European products and brands by
     Chinese industries constitutes a serious violation of international trade rules; urges the
     Chinese authorities to considerably improve the protection of Intellectual Property Rights

      (IPR);

5.    Calls at the same time for greater coherence and consistency between human rights on the
      one hand and trade and security on the other; urges therefore the EU to ensure that an
      improved trading relationship with China is contingent upon human rights reforms, and
      calls on the Council, in this regard, to make a comprehensive evaluation of the human
      rights situation before finalising any new Partnership and Cooperation Framework
      Agreement (PCFA);

6.    Welcomes, therefore, the launch and start of negotiations on a PCFA, which will cover
      the full scope of the EU-China bilateral relationship, including an effective and
      operational human rights clause, as well as strengthened and enhanced cooperation on
      political matters; reiterates its demand concerning inclusion of the European Parliament in
      all future bilateral relations between the parties, taking into account that, without
      Parliament's formal assent, there can be no PCFA;

7.    Insists that the EU arms embargo on China following the Tiananmen events must remain
      intact until substantial progress is made on human rights issues; reminds the EU Member
      States that the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports includes as a criterion respect for
      human rights in the country of final destination of such exports;

8.    Is concerned that, despite repeated assertions by the Chinese government of intentions to
      ratify the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),
      ratification is still pending; urges China therefore to ratify and implement the Covenant
      without further delay;

EU-China human rights dialogue

9.    Regrets that China's human rights record remains a matter of serious concern;
      emphasises, therefore, the need to considerably strengthen and improve the EU-China
      human rights dialogue; calls on the Council to provide a more detailed briefing to
      Parliament; considers it relevant to continue to organise the EU-China legal seminar on
      human rights, which used to precede the dialogue, with the participation of academic and
      civil society representatives, and in this regard welcomes the establishment of an EU-
      China Human Rights Academic Network under Objective 3 of the European Instrument
      for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) ; calls on the Commission to ensure that this
      network will effectively function in cooperation with Parliament;

10.   Considers that the matters discussed in the successive rounds of dialogue with China,
      such as ratification of the ICCPR, reform of the criminal justice system, including the
      death penalty and the system of re-education through work, freedom of expression,
      particularly on the Internet, freedom of the press, freedom of access to information,
      freedom of conscience, thought and religion, the situation of minorities in Tibet, the
      release of detainees following the events in Tiananmen Square, and workers' and other
      rights, must continue to be raised in the context of the dialogue, in particular with regard
      to the application of the recommendations resulting from previous dialogues mutually
      agreed upon by both parties and the seminars on legal affairs; to this end, calls on the
      Council to consider extending the time period of the dialogue and to allow more time for
      discussion of the issues raised; calls, furthermore, on the Council and Commission to pay
      special attention to compliance with International Labour Organisation conventions with
      regard, in particular, to independent trade unions and child labour;

11.   Notes China's commitment to supporting the UN Human Rights Council in performing its
      function of addressing human rights issues in a credible, objective and non-selective
      manner, and calls for strengthened cooperation in the UN system as well as cooperation
      with the UN human rights mechanisms and the international human rights standards
      provided for in the relevant international human rights instruments, including the rights of
      minorities;

12.   Draws attention to the need for China to allow the free expression and practice of religion
      and thought; affirms the need, particularly in the light of the discussions among Chinese
      officials about the definition of 'religion' and especially 'legal religion', for a
      comprehensive law on religion meeting international standards and guaranteeing genuine
      religious freedom; deplores the contradiction between the constitutional freedom of belief
      (enshrined in Article 36 of the Chinese Constitution) and the ongoing interference of the
      state in the affairs of religious communities, in particular as regards the training,
      selection, appointment and political indoctrination of ministers of religion;

13.   Regrets that the sixth Sino-Tibetan round of talks has brought about no results; calls on
      the parties to make every effort in order to continue the dialogue and calls on the Chinese
      government to engage in substantive negotiations taking into due consideration the
      demands of the Dalai Lama for autonomy for Tibet; calls on China to refrain from
      exerting pressure on states that have friendly relations with the Dalai Lama;

14.   Reiterates its concern over the reports of continuing human rights violations in Tibet and
      in the other provinces inhabited by Tibetan people, including torture, arbitrary arrest and
      detention, repression of religious freedom, arbitrary restrictions on free movement, and
      rehabilitation through labour camps; deplores the intensification of the so-called 'patriotic
      education' campaign since October 2005 in Tibet's monasteries and nunneries, forcing
      Tibetans to sign declarations denouncing the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist; calls
      on China to allow an independent body to have access to Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the
      Panchen Lama of Tibet, and his parents, as requested by the UN Committee on the Rights
      of the Child;

15.   Calls on China, as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, to implement the
      recommendations of the UN special rapporteur on torture and to issue a standing
      invitation to China to UN experts;

16.   Is of the opinion that human rights concerns should receive much more focus in the build-
      up to the Beijing Olympic Games; reiterates the need for ""respect for universal
      fundamental ethical principles"" and the promotion of a peaceful society concerned ""with
      the preservation of human dignity"" as enshrined in Articles 1 and 2 of the Olympic
      Charter;

17.   Requests the International Olympic Committee to publish its own assessment of China's
      compliance with the undertakings given in 2001 before the Games were awarded to
      Beijing; stresses the responsibility of the EU to take note of such an assessment and to
      work with its Olympic Network to create a basis for responsible behaviour in preparation
      for, during and after the Olympics;

18.   Is strongly concerned at the recent increase of political persecution related to the
      Olympics of human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, petitioners, civil society
      activists, ethnic groups such as the Uighurs, and religious people of all beliefs, especially

      Falun Gong practitioners; calls on the Chinese authorities to release these people
      immediately and to put an end to these human rights violations, as well as to the
      demolition of substantial numbers of houses without compensation to make way for the
      Olympic infrastructures;

19.   Is equally concerned about the surveillance and censorship of information on the Internet,
      and calls on the Chinese authorities to end the blocking of thousands of websites,
      including European media websites; calls on the Chinese authorities to release writer
      Yang Maodong and the other 50 cyber-dissidents and web users imprisoned in China;

20.   Calls on China to make concrete steps to grant freedom of expression, and to respect
      freedom of the press, both for Chinese and foreign journalists; is particularly concerned
      about the lack of implementation of the new regulation on international journalists active
      in China, and urges the Chinese authorities to immediately stop censoring and blocking -
      especially with the help of multinational companies - thousands of news and information
      websites based abroad; calls for the release of all journalists, Internet users and cyber-
      dissidents detained in China for exercising their right to information; reiterates its call on
      the Chinese authorities to establish a moratorium on executions during the Olympic
      Games in 2008, and to withdraw the list of 42 banned categories of people;

21.   Draws attention to the conclusions of the 17th Chinese Communist Party National
      Congress, held in mid-October 2007, at which different perspectives and degrees of
      openness arose over the implementation of higher international human rights benchmarks
      in China;

22.   Urges China to stop its ongoing support for the regime in Myanmar and the situation in
      Darfur;

     process based on open and direct dialogue that is not subject to any precondition,

–    having regard to the previous five rounds of dialogue between the Government of the
     People’s Republic of China and Envoys of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, launched in

A.   welcoming the commitment of the Government of the People’s Republic of China and

     the unity and stability of China and to the European Union’s adherence to a ‘one China’

     strengthening of the dialogue and, in the absence of tangible results on substantive issues

Tibet
European Parliament resolution on Tibet

The European Parliament,

–    having regard to its previous resolutions on Tibet and the human rights situation in China,

–    having regard to its resolution of 7 September 2006 on EU-China relations1,

–    having regard to the lack of progress in the EU-China human rights dialogue,

–    having regard to the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law
     Enforcement Officials adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention
     of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, held in Havana, Cuba between 27 August and 7
     September 1990,

–    having regard to the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,

–    having regard to the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child,

–    having regard to Rule 115(5) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   whereas on 30 September 2006 more than 70 Tibetans were attempting to cross the
     glaciated Nangpa Pass in the Himalayan region of Tibet, approximately two hours’ walk
     from the Nepalese border, in order to seek refugee status in Nepal,

B.   whereas against the rule of international law the Chinese People’s Armed Police Force
     (PAP) fired upon those unarmed Tibetan civilians, who included women and children;
     whereas video and photographic evidence of the incident shows that the Tibetan group
     was moving slowly away from the Chinese forces firing upon them, did not approach the
     Chinese forces and did not represent a threat to the Chinese forces,

C.   whereas Kelsang Namtso, a seventeen-year-old nun, was killed during the shooting by the
     Chinese PAP; whereas there are unconfirmed eyewitness accounts of more than one
     death; whereas a group of Tibetans, including children, were arrested after continuing to
     flee,

D.   whereas the Chinese State News Agency, Xinhua, has reported an incident in the region
     as ‘self-defence’ despite video and photographic evidence to the contrary; whereas the
     Chinese authorities have thus far not officially recognised that the incident at Nangpa
     Pass took place or that any individual was killed by Chinese forces,

E.   whereas since September 2002 formal contacts have been re-established between the
     Chinese authorities and the representatives of the Dalai Lama in order to restore mutual
     trust and confidence,


1
     Texts Adopted, P6_TA(2006)0346.

F.    whereas, despite these contacts and the importance attached to the meetings by the central
      Chinese authorities, there have been frequent cases over the past years of abuses and
      violations of human rights perpetrated against the Tibetan population, and in particular
      against Tibetan monks,

1.    Condemns the excessive use of force by the Chinese People’s Armed Police Force in
      firing upon unarmed Tibetan civilians, including children;

2.    Strongly condemns the killing of an unarmed civilian who, being under 18 years of age,
      was also considered a child under international law;

3.    Expresses its dismay at the imprisonment of Tibetan civilians, nine of whom are children;

4.    Urges the Chinese authorities to guarantee that the Tibetans detained during the incident
      will not be ill-treated in detention and that international human rights and humanitarian
      law standards are being respected;

5.    Urges the Chinese authorities to release immediately all children detained following the
      incident;

6.    Urges the Chinese authorities to conduct a full investigation into the events at Nangpa

      justice;

7.    Calls on the Council and the Commission to monitor closely, through their
      representations in Nepal, the situation of those Tibetans from the group who have reached
      Nepal and to make strong representations to the Chinese authorities on this issue within
      the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue;

8.    Calls on the Council and the Commission to reiterate their position that only dialogue
      between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the representatives of the
      Dalai Lama can contribute to a peaceful and sustainable settlement for Tibet that both
      sides agree upon;

9.    Calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China to continue its dialogue with
      the representatives of the Dalai Lama in order to improve respect for religious, cultural,
      linguistic and political rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region;

10.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the

Taiwan
European Parliament resolution on Taiwan


The European Parliament,

–    having regard to its resolution of 14 March 2002 on observer status for Taiwan at the May
     2002 annual meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva1,

–    having regard to its resolution of 15 May 2003 on Taiwan (56th World Health
     Assembly)2, calling for observer status for Taiwan at that Assembly,

–    having regard to its resolution of 5 September 2002 on the Commission Communication
     on Europe and Asia: A Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships3, in which it
     recognised the need to cooperate closely with Asia in multilateral organisations, for
     example in combating HIV/AIDS in the region through the World Health Organisation
     (WHO), and, therefore, took the view that all democracies in Asia, including Taiwan,
     should be able to participate in the WHO,

–    having regard to its resolution of 7 July 2005 on relations between the EU, China and
     Taiwan and security in the Far East4,

–    having regard to Rule 115(5) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.   having regard to the necessity of direct and unobstructed participation in international
     health cooperation networks, forums and programmes for all parts of the world, especially
     with today’s greater potential for the cross-border spread of various infectious diseases
     (such as avian influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)),

B.   whereas the WHO has allowed observers to participate in its activities,

C.   whereas the Commission has also already declared itself in favour of enhancing contacts
     between Taiwan and the WHO, insofar as WHO rules permit; whereas, furthermore, the
     Commission is interested in finding a ‘practical solution’ together with the Member
     States,

D.   whereas the greatest risk of an influenza pandemic emanates from Asian countries, where
     a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strain has been spreading for two years despite
     continued efforts by competent authorities to contain the disease,

E.   whereas infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and SARS are
     becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide,

     Texts Adopted, P6_TA(2005)0297.

F.   whereas the outbreak of a pandemic outside the EU would also entail a serious health
     threat to the citizens of the EU,

G.   whereas Taiwan would be excluded from UN protection if an epidemic were to break out
     on the island, which means that there would be no coordinated cooperation with Taiwan,
     despite this being essential since Taiwan is one of the most important international hubs
     in the Western Pacific as well as an important staging area for millions of migratory birds,

H.   whereas Taiwan's health-care system is one of the best and most advanced in the region
     and the Taiwanese authorities wish to let their specialists participate in the WHO's
     preparatory meetings of experts on the avian flu situation,

1.   Insists on the better representation of Taiwan in international organisations and takes the
     view that it is unfair to continue to exclude more than twenty million people from the
     world community;

2.   Calls on the Director-General of the WHO to immediately include the Taiwan Centre for
     Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) as a participant in the WHO Global Outbreak and Alert
     Response Network (GOARN), to ensure the rapid exchange of relevant information on a
     regional and global basis;

3.   Calls on the Director-General of the WHO and all its member States to ensure that
     Taiwan has direct access to and can attend all technical meetings of the WHO which are
     relevant to the maintenance and improvement of public health in Taiwan and the rest of
     the world and, in addition, to allow Taiwan to meaningfully participate in the technical
     activities and events of the relevant Regional Office of the WHO;

4.   Calls on the People's Republic of China to consider the possibility of observer status for
     Taiwan within the WHO, or at least in the WHA as its most important decision-making
     body, in order to protect the health of the people of Taiwan, of international
     representatives and foreign employees on the island, and of the entire world population;

5.   Reiterates its call on the Commission and the Member States to support Taiwan's
     application for observer status in the WHO;

6.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
     governments and parliaments of the Member States and the candidate and accession
     countries, the Government and Parliament of the People's Republic of China, the
     authorities of Taiwan, the UN Secretary-General and the Director-General of the WHO.

        been tortured,

D.      whereas it is not yet clear whether more protesters have been arrested,

E.      whereas more than 400 Tibetan monks from Drepung Monastery in Lhasa protested

H.      whereas the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on
        torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Manfred Nowak,

        used in China, and believes that the practice of torture remains widespread in China,

        immediately;

6.      Urges the Chinese authorities to cease the 'patriotic education' campaign, to react in a

Case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche
European Parliament resolution on the case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche

The European Parliament,

–     recalling its earlier resolutions on Tibet and the human rights situation in China,

–     having regard to its resolutions of 18 November 2004 on ‘Tibet, the case of Tenzin Delek
      Rinpoche’ 1,and of 13 January 2005 on Tibet2,

–     having regard to its resolution of 28 April 2005 on the Annual Report on Human Rights
      in the World 2004 and the EU’s policy on the matter3,

–     having regard to the report and recommendations of the EU-China Human Rights
      Dialogue Seminar of 20-21 June 2005,

–     having regard to the Joint Statement of the 8th EU-China Summit of 5 September 2005,

–     having regard to Rule 115(5) of its Rules of Procedure,

A.    whereas on 2 December 2002 the Kardze Intermediate People’s Court in the Kardze
      Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province sentenced Tenzin Delek Rinpoche,
      an influential and respected Buddhist lama, to death with a two-year suspension and his
      attendant, Lobsang Dhondup, to death without suspension,

B.    whereas the involvement of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and Lobsang Dhondup in a series of
      bombings or in incitement to separatism has not been proved,

C.    whereas Lobsang Dhondup was executed on 26 January 2003,

D.    whereas in accordance with Chinese law – given that the accused did not break the law
      again during the two-year suspension period – and in response to immense pressure from
      the international community and human rights organisations, the death sentence on
      Tenzin Delek Rinpoche was commuted to life imprisonment on 26 January 2005,

E.    whereas human rights organisations report that, owing to torture and the inhuman
      conditions of his imprisonment, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche’s state of health is so poor that
      there is serious concern for his survival, and that he is unable to speak or walk,

F.    whereas information concerning the state of health of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche cannot be

F. whereas, despite the fact that Article 36 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of
   China provides for freedom of religious belief, the authorities seek in reality to restrict
   religious practice to government-sanctioned organisations and registered places of worship,
   and to control the growth and scope of the activities of religious groups,

G. whereas China’s new Regulations on Religious Affairs, which came into effect on 1 March
   2005, have tightened government control on religious activity,

H. whereas, amongst other Christian denominations, the Catholic Church has endured a long
   period of persecution in the People’s Republic of China and is still forced to act partly
   underground as a consequence of these practices,

I. whereas the Chinese authorities have intensified their control of unregistered Protestant
   house churches and interference in the process of appointing bishops,

2. Urges the Chinese Government to abolish the difference between approved and
   non-approved worship communities, as has been suggested by the UN Special Rapporteur

3. Calls on the Commission and the Council to make it clear to the Chinese authorities that a
   genuine partnership can only develop when shared values are fully respected and put into
   practice;

4. Urges the Commission, the Council and the Member States to raise specifically the issue of
   the persecution of Chinese Christians, and to obtain from the Chinese Government:

   (a) information about the situation of Catholic bishops Mgr James Su Zhimin (diocese of
       Baoding, Hebei), 72; Mgr Francis An Shuxin (auxiliary bishop of the diocese of

       Baoding, Hebei); and Fr Liu Deli; and demands the unconditional release of all Chinese
       Catholics incarcerated on account of their religious convictions and the immediate

       cessation of all kinds of violence towards them;

   (b) information about the situation of Pastor Zhang Rongliang (53), one of the founders of
       the China for Christ Church, a group comprising more than 10 million Christians, who
       was arrested on 1 December 2004, and who is still imprisoned without any legal
       process; demands the unconditional release of this pastor and of all other Chinese
       Christians incarcerated on account of their religious convictions and the immediate
       cessation of all kinds of violence towards them;

5. Urges the Chinese Government to implement Article 36 of the Constitution of the People’s
   Republic of China and to ratify and implement the International Covenant on Civil and
   Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;

6. Notes that the Chinese Government has finally accepted the request made by the UN
   Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief and the Special Rapporteur on Torture
   to visit China before the end of the year; invites the Chinese Government to set an early
   date for this visit; calls on the Chinese authorities to allow access for the UN Special
   Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief to the Panchen Lama as designated by the
   Dalai Lama;

7. Welcomes the existence of an EU-China human rights structured dialogue; expresses
   disappointment at the lack of substantial results coming from this dialogue; invites the
   Council and the Commission to raise this issue of concern during the forthcoming EU-
   China human rights session, as part of a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of the
   structured dialogue;

8. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
   Governments and Parliaments of the Member States and the accession and candidate
   countries, the member countries of the UN Commission on Human Rights and the
   Government of the People’s Republic of China.

The European Parliament,

–     having regard to its resolution of 14 April 2005 on the annual report from the Council to
      the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of CFSP, including the
      financial implications for the general budget of the European Communities - 20031,

–     having regard to its resolution of 28 April 2005 on the Annual Report on Human Rights
      in the World 2004 and the EU's policy on the matter2,

–     having regard to the Commission Communication on 'Europe and Asia: A Strategic
      Framework for Enhanced Partnerships' (COM(2001)0469),

–     having regard to its resolution of 13 April 2000 on Taiwan3,

–     having regard to Rule 103(4) of its Rules of Procedure,


A.    whereas relations between China and Taiwan are continuing to deteriorate owing to
      recent threats by China against Taiwan and the ongoing stationing of hundreds of
      missiles in the southern provinces of China facing Taiwan,

B.    whereas tensions have arisen in relations between Japan and China, caused by Chinese
      riots against Japanese interests and calls to boycott Japanese products,

C.    reiterating that Taiwan has in recent years expressed a willingness to assist financially
      and technically in international aid and health activities supported by the WHO,

D.    whereas the fifth Asia-Europe meeting – the ASEM 5 Summit – in Hanoi on
      7-9 October 2004 and the seventh meeting of Foreign Ministers of the ASEM countries
      on 6-7 May 2005 in Kyoto raise hopes that the ASEM process will be further
      strengthened on all levels, including the Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership, with a
      view to fostering peace and stability in the Far East,

E.    noting that, with the burgeoning economic and trade relationship between Europe and the
      Far East, peace and security in the region are increasingly vital for the EU,

     OJ C 40, 7.2.2001, p. 428.

1.    Deplores the tensions among various countries in the Far East and expresses its
      willingness to support all endeavours to support peace and stability in the Far East;

2.    Underlines the basic principles of multi-party democracy, the rule of law and compliance
      with universal human rights as preconditions for lasting peace and stability in the Far
      East;

3.    Calls on China and Taiwan to establish mutual trust and respect and to seek common
      ground while setting aside differences, to put in place the necessary political basis for a
      peaceful and steady development of cross-Straits relations and to resume dialogue on
      those relations, to strengthen economic exchange and cooperation, particularly pushing
      forward the 'three direct links' across the Taiwan Strait (mail, transport and trade);

4.    Points out that any arrangement between China and Taiwan can only be achieved on a
      mutually acceptable basis; expresses the view that the future of cross-Straits relations will
      depend on both sides' willingness to demonstrate flexibility; supports Taiwan's
      achievements as regards the establishment of a fully-fledged democratic system, social
      pluralism, and respect for human rights and the rule of law, and takes the view that the
      will and approval of the 23 million people in Taiwan must be respected and taken into
      account with a view to a hopefully peaceful solution between the parties;

5.    Objects to the anti-secession law because it does not comply with international law and is
      a tool that cannot successfully lead to 'peaceful national reunification', which was its
      declared goal, and it therefore undermines the fragile security balance in the Far East;

6.    Strongly recommends to the Council and the Commission that the arms embargo remain
      intact until greater progress is made on human rights issues in China and on cross-Straits
      relations, as well as until the EU makes its code of conduct on arms sales legally binding;

7.    Calls on China gradually to implement universal human rights and especially to ratify
      promptly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;

8.    Welcomes the resumption of the first session of the fourth round of talks in the
      framework of the Sino-Tibetan dialogue which took place in Bern (Switzerland) from 30
      June to 1 July 2005, and calls for it to continue;

9.    Calls for a better representation of Taiwan in international organisations and reiterates its
      call on the Commission and the Member States to support Taiwan's application for
      observer status in the World Health Organisation;

10.   Is deeply concerned that North Korea declared on 10 February 2005 that it possesses
      nuclear weapons and suspended its participation in the six-party talks on its nuclear
      programme for an indefinite period;

11.   Urges North Korea to rejoin the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, to revoke its decision
      to withdraw from the six-party talks and to allow the resumption of negotiations in order
      to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in the Korean peninsula;

12.   Calls on the Council and the Commission to offer financial support for heavy fuel oil
      supplies to meet North Korea's primary energy needs, subject to a verified freezing of the

      Yongbyon plant; welcomes the EU participation in the Korean Energy Development
      Organisation (KEDO); regrets the blocking of Charles Kartman's reappointment as head
      of KEDO; asks the Commission and the Council to make the necessary approaches
      regarding full EU participation in future six-party talks;

13.   Calls on the governments of Japan, China and the Korean peninsula to stop any adversary
      action against each other, to facilitate dialogue among the nations at official and
      unofficial level with a view to reaching a common understanding of history, and to
      achieve a final reconciliation between their governments and peoples as an important
      basis for peace and stability in the Far East;

14.   Notes Japan's understandable wish to revise its constitution drafted in the aftermath of
      World War II and notes the symbolic importance of retaining a commitment to refrain
      from aggressive military action;

15.   Urges all countries in the Far East to seek bilateral agreements to resolve the outstanding
      territorial disputes in the region, in particular:

      (a) the return to Japan of the 'Northern territories' that were occupied by the then Soviet
          Union at the end of World War II and are currently occupied by Russia,

      (b) the dispute over the ownership of the Dokdo/Takeshima Islands between South
          Korea and Japan,

      (c) the dispute over the ownership of Senkaku–Daioyutai between Japan and Taiwan;

16.   Calls on all countries in the Far East to seek reconciliation among themselves sixty years
      after the end of World War II and to establish a system of mutual understanding and
      cooperation in order to secure lasting peace and stability in the Far East, and declares its
      willingness to support these endeavours;

17.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Secretary-General of the United
      Nations and the governments and parliaments of the countries mentioned herein.

European Parliament resolution on arms sales to China


The European Parliament,

–     having regard to the Declaration on China made by the European Council in Madrid on
      26 June 1989 following the brutal repression that took place in China at that time,
      introducing an embargo on trade in arms with China, the scope of which has been left for
      national interpretation,

–     having regard to the conclusions of the European Summit of 12-13 December 2003,

–     having regard to the conclusions of the 6th Summit meeting between China and the
      European Union held in Beijing on 30 October 2003,

–     having regard to the recent release of both EU and China policy papers on EU-China
      relations, which pave the way for the development of relations in the years to come,

Hong Kong
European Parliament resolution on Hong Kong


The European Parliament,

–     having regard to the constructive dialogue which the European Parliament has maintained
      with the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and to
      the importance which the rule of law has played in the development of Hong Kong,

–     having regard to the decision of the Government of the Hong Kong Special
      Administrative Region to publish a consultation paper unveiling its proposals for an anti-
      subversion law under Article 23 of the Basic Law,

–     having regard to its resolutions of 8 October 19981 and 26 October 20002 on Hong Kong,
      in which concerns were raised regarding future legislation under Article 23,

A.    whereas the three-month public consultation period, after which draft legislation will be
      finalised, ends on 24 December 2002,

B.    whereas this legislation will apply to every single person in Hong Kong,

C.    whereas it will also apply to all Hong Kong permanent residents, whether Chinese or non-
      Chinese nationals, and also to what they do outside Hong Kong,

D.    whereas that the HKSAR Government's consultative document has stated as a guiding
      principle that any legislation passed will not undermine the freedoms, including freedom
      of media, guaranteed in the Basic Law,

E.    having regard to the widespread concern expressed by certain religious leaders, some
      Hong Kong Legco members, human rights groups and Hong Kong lawyers regarding the
      proposed legislation,

1.    Believes that the proposed legislation must follow the 'one country, two systems' policy
      enshrined under the Basic Law;

2.    Believes further that the new legislation must not be subject to Article 19 of the Basic
      Law, and that Article 23 offences must remain within the exclusive jurisdiction of Hong
      Kong courts;

3.    Calls on the HKSAR government to ensure that Article 23 proposals will not be used to
      silence opposition, restrict freedom of speech, of the press and of publication, freedom of
      association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, the right and freedom to

1    OJ C 328, 26.10.1998, p. 186.
2    OJ C 197, 12.7.2001, p. 387.

     form and join trade unions and to strike, and the right to engage in academic research,
     literary and artistic creation and other cultural activities, in accordance with Articles 27
     and 34 of the Basic Law;

4.   Believes that all proposed offences should be tightly defined and should specifically
     exclude the possibility of peaceful protests falling into the definition of crimes covered by
     Article 23;

5.   Repeats the call made in its abovementioned resolutions that the HKSAR should not
     introduce laws under Article 23 which violate the provisions of the International
     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;

6.   Calls on the HKSAR administration, at the end of the current consultation period, to
     publish a draft bill setting out clearly detailed provisions to ensure that Hong Kong
     citizens are fully aware of the implications of the new legislation, to be followed by
     further consultation;

7.   Reiterates its position that respect for the full autonomy of Hong Kong is one of the key
     issues upon which to base the development of future relations between the EU and China;

8.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the
     HKSAR Government.

  European Parliament resolution on Beijing's bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games

  The European Parliament,


  -    having regard to its previous resolutions on the situation in the People's Republic of China

  -    having regard to the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 19 March 2001, in
       which the Council expressed its concern at the serious human rights violations in the
       People's Republic of China,

  -    recalling the city of Beijing's bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games,

  -    recalling that the Charter of the Olympic Games states that Olympism has as a goal 'to
       place sport at the service of the harmonious development of humankind, with the object of
       creating a peaceful society with the preservation of human dignity',

  A.    whereas the repression of freedom of opinion and freedom to hold demonstrations in
        favour of democracy that has been practised for decades, is continuing in the PRC,
        despite international protests,

  B.    having regard to the repression of religious, ethnic and other minorities, in particular
        Tibetans, Uighurs and Mongolians and the Falun Gong movement,

  C.    having regard to the frequent imposition of capital punishment, leading to over a
        thousand reported executions in China every year, as well as the widespread use of
        torture on the part of the Chinese police and military forces,

  D.    recalling that the PRC has still not ratified the International Convention on Civil and
        Political Rights,

  E     whereas the Chinese authorities have taken no significant initiatives on respect for human
        rights, despite the ongoing political dialogue between the EU and the PRC,

  F.    concerned with regard to environmental and animal welfare issues in the PRC,

  G.    stressing that the plans relating to Beijing's bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games would
        involve the destruction of a large part of the old city and the obligatory transfer of the
        inhabitants to the surrounding areas,

  H.    recalling that the International Olympic Committee is due to designate, on 13 July 2001
        in Moscow, the city that will host the 2008 Olympic Games,

  1.    Invites the International Olympic Committee to establish guidelines to include respect for
        human rights and democratic principles to be applied as a general rule to host countries of
        Olympic Games,

RC\444972EN.doc                                                                 PE 307.309}

EN

  2.    Regrets that the PRC demonstrably fails to uphold universal human, civil and political
        rights, including freedom of religion and therefore believes that this negative record and
        the repression in Tibet as well as in Ouighouristan and in South Mongolia, make it
        inappropriate to award the 2008 Olympic Games to Beijing;

  3.    Urges the International Olympic Committee in any case to make a thorough
        environmental impact assessment with regard in particular to the recurrent water
        shortages, the impact of mass tourism and the social repercussions in the region
        surrounding Beijing;

  4.    Invites the International Olympic Committee to reconsider Beijing's candidacy when the
        authorities of the PRC have made a fundamental change in their policy on human rights,
        and the promotion of democracy and the rule of law;

  5.    Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
        Presidents of the parliaments of the Member States, and to the International Olympic
        Committee.

        rights,

  –     having regard to Article 18 on freedom of religion of the United Nations Universal
        Declaration of Human Rights,

  A.    concerned that, having signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

        Republic of China has still not finalised the ratification and implementation processes,

  B.    concerned at the lack of respect for fundamental freedoms in China, including freedom of
        expression, religion and association, at the ongoing violations of human rights of pro-

        administrative detention, the situation with regard to the human rights of prisoners, the
        cases of torture and the frequent use of the death penalty,

  E.    stressing that the US has decided to table a draft resolution on Human Rights in China at

  European Parliament resolution on freedom of religion in the People’s Republic of China



  The European Parliament,

  -     recalling its previous resolutions on the human rights situation in China, on Tibet and on
        the Union's priorities and recommendations for the March 2001 session of the UN
        Human Rights Commission in Geneva,

  -     having regard to the conclusions of the EU-PRC summit meeting of 21 December 1999
        and the Council conclusions of 22 January 2001 on the EU-PRC dialogue on human
        rights,

  -     having regard to Article 18 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human
        Rights on freedom of religion,

  A.    whereas, in its report (COM(2000)552 final) on the Implementation of the
        Communication ‘Building a comprehensive partnership with China’, the Commission
        notes that the situation in China has regressed in terms of respect for civil, political and
        religious rights, a finding which is endorsed in the conclusions of the General Affairs
        Council of 22 January 2001,

  B.    whereas, ever since making it compulsory for places of worship to be registered in 1994,
        the authorities of the PRC have been unceasing in their efforts to further limit the
        exercise of the freedom of religion,

  C.    whereas State control over religion is already evident in the restricted number of religions
        that are officially recognised, and whereas any religious activity that has not been
        registered by the official associations is regarded as illegal,

  D.    whereas, although the zeal with which the policy of repressing religious activity is
        enforced varies depending on the attitude of the local governments, in the supposedly
        autonomous Region of Tibet that policy is pursued systematically and implacably,

  E.    whereas the religious, cultural and national heritage of the Tibetan people is threatened
        with extinction,

  F.    whereas the Falun Gong organisation was officially declared illegal in China on 22 July
        1999, an arrest warrant was issued for its founder, Li Hung-Zhi on 29 July, and in the last
        two years, according to reports, some 50 000 members of the Falun Gong movement
        have been arrested, of whom almost 25 000 are now in prison, have been sent to forced
        labour camp or have been forcibly committed to mental hospitals, while to date 137 of
        them have died after being ill-treated or tortured in the course of their arrest or detention,

  G.    noting that since 1989, when the Vatican set up its own Bishops’ Conference, tensions

        between the authorities in Beijing and the non-official Catholic Church have increased
        significantly and many prominent members of the clergy of the non-official Catholic
        Church are still in prison, or have had restrictions placed on their freedom of movement,
        as a result of their refusal to support the official Church,

  H.    drawing attention to the policy of expulsion and systematic arrest of foreign Protestant
        priests and the harassment to which members of unregistered Protestant churches are
        subjected by the administrative authorities,

  I.    condemning the destruction of mosques and the arrest of persons who have taught the
        Koran without having received prior authorisation from the authorities,

  1.    Calls on China to release all those detained or imprisoned for peacefully exercising their
        internationally recognised rights to freedom of belief, religion and conscience;

  2.    Calls for the constitutional right to freedom of religion and belief to be fully guaranteed,
        together with the exercise of the associated rights of freedom of conscience, freedom of
        expression, freedom of association and freedom of assembly;

  3.    Regrets that, after having signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
        and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the PRC has
        still not finalised the ratification and implementation processes;

  4.    Reiterates its condemnation of the continued and severe violation of human rights in
        Tibet and the ongoing discrimination practised against the Tibetan people by the PRC
        authorities on the basis of race or ethnic origin or religious, cultural or political beliefs;

  5.    Invites the PRC government to allow Falun Gong practitioners to practice their
        fundamental right to freedom of conscience, expression, association and assembly in
        accordance with the PRC constitution;

  6.    Calls for the European Union and its Member States to submit a resolution to the United
        Nation Commission on Human Rights at its meeting in Geneva to condemn all violations
        of religious rights and, in particular, those directed against Tibetan and Mongolian
        monks, certain Christian churches and certain Muslim communities;

  7.    Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
        parliaments of the Member States, the Office of the UNHC for Human Rights and the
        PRC Government and Parliament.

  European Parliament resolution on the Western China Poverty Reduction Project and the
  future of Tibet



  The European Parliament,

  -   having regard to its previous resolutions on Tibet,

  -   having regard to the lack of progress in the EU-China human rights dialogue,

  A. whereas on 7 July 2000 the World Bank is expected to take a final decision on its support for
     the Western China Poverty Reduction Project,

  B. recalling that Tibet was invaded and occupied in 1949 and 1950 by the Chinese armed
     forces,

  C. recalling that, whilst the 'seventeen-point agreement' signed in Beijing under duress by the
     Tibetan authorities sanctioned the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China, it
     also guaranteed Tibet's full autonomy and, in particular, the continuity of its political system
     and full respect for religious freedom,

  D. recalling the Lhasa uprising against the Beijing regime on 10 March 1959, which resulted in
     the deaths and imprisonment of thousands of Tibetans and the exile of the Dalai Lama and
     tens of thousands of other Tibetans,

  E. recalling the establishment in 1965 of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) by the Beijing
     authorities and considering that no genuine autonomy has existed there since China occupied
     the country,

  F. recalling the repeated attempts at restarting the dialogue with the Beijing authorities made by
     the Dalai Lama, notably through the 'five-point plan' presented to the US Congress in 1987
     and the 'Strasbourg proposal' presented to the European Parliament in 1988,

  G. concerned that China has shown no readiness to take part in a dialogue to negotiate the future
     of Tibet,

  H. recalling the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 to the Dalai Lama and his appeal to the
     international community to encourage a peaceful settlement of the Tibetan question,

  I. recalling Tibet's designation in 1992 as a 'Special Economic Zone' and the resulting large-
     scale transfer of Chinese settlers to Tibet which, in the space of a few years, has made the
     Tibetans a minority in their own country,

  J. whereas the proposed Western China Poverty Reduction Project may lead to a further
     relocation of ethnic Chinese into the Tibetan areas and may violate the World Bank's own
     policies regarding indigenous peoples, involuntary resettlement and the environment,

EN

  1. Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to do all they can to start up
     negotiations between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Dalai Lama
     on a new status for Tibet which guarantees full Tibetan autonomy in all areas of political,
     economic, social and cultural life, the only exceptions being defence and foreign policy;

  2. Asks the Commission and the Council to urge the World Bank to suspend its decision on the
     Western China Poverty Reduction Project and to examine all the effects this project could
     have on Tibet's ethnic, cultural and social balance;

  3. Urges the World Bank to publish the Inspection Panel report and Recommendation on the
     Western China Poverty Reduction Project before the vote of the World Bank Board;

  4. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
     parliaments of the Member States, the governments and parliaments of the applicant

B.   whereas the voter turnout for the election of over 82% indicates a very high level of

D.   deeply concerned by the threats of the Chinese authorities who tried to affect and
     undermine the electoral campaign,

E.   whereas on 21 February 2000 the People’s Republic of China (PRC) published a White
     Paper in which it threatens to use military force, not only if Taiwan should proclaim
     independence, but also if Taiwan keeps delaying indefinitely talks on an eventual
     reunification with China,

F.   whereas Mr Chen has said he will not declare independence and right after the elections
     offered to meet China’s leaders for a “peace summit”,

G.   stressing the positive and constructive role that Taiwan could play in the region with
     regard to respect for human rights, the development of democracy and consolidation of the
     rule of law,

1.   Welcomes the outcome of the Presidential election as a further proof of Taiwan’s
     development into a fully fledged democracy;

2.   Rejects any military threats and calls on both China and Taiwan to refrain from any kind
     of provocative action;

3.   Calls on China and Taiwan to use dialogue and negotiations to find a solution to their
     differences and welcomes the statements of the newly elected President offering to the
     People’s Republic of China the possibility to negotiate immediately the establishment of
     trade relations and direct transportation between them;

4.   Notes the commitment of the PRC and Taiwan regarding eventual reunification on the
     basis of a One China policy based on democratic development, respect for human rights
     and the rule of law;

5.   Reiterates that cooperation among Asian countries in a constructive and peaceful spirit
     and good cooperation between Asian countries and the European Union is in the broader
     interests of the European Union;

6.   Calls on EU Member States and the Commission to step up their relations with Taiwan
     with a view to securing better representation for Taiwan in international fora (including
     the WTO) and to open a European Commission Representative office in Taipei;

7.   Invites its Delegation for Relations with China to find ways of establishing relations with
     the Parliament of Taiwan;

  on Tibet


  The European Parliament,

  –    having regard to its earlier resolutions on the occupation of Tibet and the repression of its
       people by the Chinese authorities,

  A. whereas respect for human rights is a prominent priority of EU policies and one of the
     founding principles of the Union,

  B. whereas the Peking government is refusing to allow Mrs Mary Robinson, the United
     Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to have access to Tibet,

  C. pointing out that informal talks under way between the Chinese Government and the
     Tibetan religious authorities have not led to an improvement in the human rights situation in
     Tibet, particularly freedom of expression,

  D. having regard to His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s appeal to the international community to act
     for a peaceful solution of the Tibetan problem,

  E.   having regard to the conclusions on China issued by the Council during the General Affairs
       Council meeting of 20 March 2000,

  F.   having regard to the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights,

  G. deeply concerned by the fact that the EU-China Human Rights dialogue has not produced
     enough progress on the ground and reiterating the importance it attaches to the opportunity
     presented by the EU-China Human Rights dialogue and Cooperation programme, which
     foresees joint work on the promotion and respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms
     in China,

  H. deeply concerned by the fact that the Tibetan cultural and spiritual heritage is threatened
     with extinction, inter alia by a large-scale transfer of ethnic Chinese to Tibet and the
     continuing and widespread restrictions on fundamental freedoms, notably freedom of
     assembly, expression, association and religion,

  1.   Condemns the ongoing discrimination of the Tibetan people by the People’s Republic of
       China on religious, political, educational, language and cultural grounds;

  2.   Calls on the Chinese government to open the dialogue, without pre-conditions, on the future
       of Tibet, with the Dalai Lama and on the basis of his five-point peace plan: (1)
       Transformation of the whole of Tibet into a zone of peace; (2) Abandonment of China’s
       population-transfer policy; (3) Respect for the Tibetan people’s fundamental human rights

       and democratic freedoms; (4) Restoration and protection of Tibet’s natural environment; (5)
       Commencement of earnest negotiations on the future autonomous status of Tibet;

  3.   Calls on the Commission and the Council to express publicly their concerns about the
       situation in Tibet and in China and to raise them in meetings with China at all levels and
       expects the Council to abandon its ‘no action’ approach to China, which is preventing the
       human rights situation in China from being discussed;

  4.   Urges the Council to take the initiative, at the current session of the UN Human Rights
       Commission in Geneva, on the adoption of a resolution expressing concern at the serious
       human rights violations perpetrated in China, including the continual oppression of Tibet;

  5.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
       government of China, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Parliament in exile of Tibet.

A.   whereas the human rights situation in China has continued to deteriorate with an
     increasingly high number of executions, further suppression of organised political dissent,
     intensification of controls on unregistered churches and interference in the process of
     appointment of Roman Catholic bishops, the official banning of the Falun Gong movement
     and harassment of ethnic minority groups, especially Tibetans, Mongolians and Uighurs,

B.   whereas China has made no progress in ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and
     Political Rights nor the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,

C.   whereas, with regard to Hong Kong, the undertakings relating to freedom of expression,
     political freedom, and the rule of law, given by China in the Hong Kong Basic Law and the
     handover of power, are being infringed, for instance through the request to the NPC
     Standing Committee to reinterpret parts of the Basic Law after the judgment of the Hong
     Kong Court of Final Appeal,

D.   whereas the flight of Tibet's Karmapa Lama to Dharmshala is indicative of religious
     repression,

E.   whereas Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo and Vice Minister Long Yongtu will visit
     Brussels on 25 January 2000 to discuss China's accession to the WTO with EU
     representatives,

F.   whereas the 56th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights is scheduled for 20
     March 2000 in Geneva,

1.   Urges the Chinese Government to respond to international calls for improvement in the
     human rights situation and to guarantee democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of the
     media and political and religious freedom in China, in particular in Hong Kong and Macao,
     as well as in Tibet;

2.   Calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to continue to exert pressure
     on China to improve her human rights record in accordance with international standards
     and to make clear to the Chinese Government that progress in EU-China relations,
     including China's WTO accession, is linked to such an improvement;

3.   Urges the Commission, the Council and the Member States to raise specifically the issue of
     religious persecution, since there is an increasing trend towards violations of freedom of
     religion;

4.   Calls on the Council to join efforts with the USA and co-sponsor a resolution on China at
     the forthcoming session of the UN Human Rights Commission and to work actively,
     through high-level diplomatic lobbying, to encourage the other members in the Human
     Rights Commission to do likewise, while discouraging countries represented in Geneva
     from voting for a no-action motion on China, which would prevent the Human Rights
     Commission from even discussing the situation in that country;

5.    Urges the Chinese Government to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political
      Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;

NTDTV Television broadcasts to China via Eutelsat
Declaration of the European Parliament on restoring NTDTV Television broadcasts to
China via Eutelsat


The European Parliament,

– having regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, signed and
  proclaimed on 7 December 2000, which defends the freedom and pluralism of the media,

– having regard to Rule 116 of its Rules of Procedure,

A. whereas the European Union is based on and defined by its adherence to the principles of
   freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of
   law,

B. whereas freedom of speech, particularly that of the media, including the Internet, is heavily
   restricted in China,

C. whereas NTDTV is a non-profit-making television broadcaster and is the only independent
   Chinese-language television station to broadcast into China since 2004,

D. whereas Eutelsat suspended NTDTV’s broadcasts into China as of 16 June 2008, a few
   weeks before the Olympic Games, citing technical reasons, and provided no other
   explanation,

1. Urges Eutelsat to resume NTDTV transmission to China without delay and to provide
   reasons for its suspension;

2. Calls on the Commission and Member States to take the necessary action to help restore
   NTDTV’s broadcasts to China and to support access to uncensored information for millions
   of Chinese citizens;

3. Instructs its President to forward this declaration, together with the names of the signatories,
   to the Council, the Commission and the Member States:

3
    OJ C 21, 25.1.1993, p. 78.

      security issues, together with the development of human rights and of the rule of law,

C.    whereas the Commission has been examining ways of furthering the EU-China
      partnership, and whereas the European Parliament fully supports the EU's position, in
      particular as expressed in the EU-China summits, held annually since 1998, which have
      provided a platform to give added momentum to the EU-China relationship; and whereas
      separate dialogues and meetings between the relevant officials on both sides on numerous
      issues of mutual concern take place,




1
     OJ C 65E, 14.3.2002, p. 365.

D.    whereas an overall framework for political dialogue between the EU and China was first
      formalised in 1994 through an exchange of letters,

E.    whereas the thus far successful political, social, economic and cultural experiences of
      Hong Kong and Macao represent a significant and concrete start to such dialogue and
      cooperation,

F.    concerned nevertheless about the fact that the Chinese government appears intent on
      forcibly separating 11,000 mainland-born children of Hong Kong permanent residents
      from their parents by removing them to the mainland,

G.    whereas the Olympic Games to be held in China in 2008 could prove a major opportunity
      for the deepening of cooperation in all fields if China puts an end to human rights
      violations and makes substantial progress in the democratisation of its political system,

H.    whereas the human rights situation in China still causes serious concern, as the
      crackdown on fundamental freedoms continues and torture, ill-treatment, arbitrary
      detention and executions are still used to punish peaceful dissent and against religious
      communities,

Introduction

1.    Welcomes the Commission communication;

2.    Welcomes the new progress made in developing EU-China relations over the last three
      years;

3.    Takes note of China's positive response to the communication and urges China to take the
      necessary concrete steps to demonstrate its willingness to tackle a broad swathe of issues
      which are of major concern to the EU;

4.    Welcomes China's support in the international fight against terrorism and, in particular, its
      recent rapprochement with India over mutual security issues, in spite of long-standing
      territorial disputes and notwithstanding its long-term friendship with Pakistan; stresses,
      however, that anti-terrorist measures can never excuse human rights abuses, such as
      repression of ethnic groups and religious communities;

5.    Welcomes China's undertaking to assist in the reconstruction of Afghanistan; believes
      that this project could serve as a specific benchmark for cooperation between China and
      the EU;

6.    Recalls its resolution of 13 June 2001 on the Commission working document:
      Perspectives and Priorities for the ASEM Process (Asia Europe Meeting) into the new
      decade (COM(2000) 24l - C5-0505/2000 - 2000/2243(COS))1; urges the Chinese
      Government to take a more favourable attitude to the early enlargement of ASEM, in
      particular as regards India and other countries;


1
     OJ C 53 E, 28.2.2002, p.227.

7.    Recognises that the partnership between the EU and China on the basis of equal status
      and mutual advantage has expanded considerably in recent years; notes that it is
      necessary, however, in order to consolidate these relations on the basis of partnership, to
      strengthen and further develop dialogue in the political, economic, scientific and cultural
      fields;

8.    Notes the need for an intense cultural dialogue between Europe and China; proposes in
      this context that Member State universities create/expand their departments of Chinese
      studies and invites the Commission to study the possibility of enlarging the existing
      programmes, e.g. Tempus, in order to promote projects for reciprocal university
      exchanges;

9.    Acknowledges that the beginnings of democratic representation at municipal level
      constitute a step in the right direction towards participative democracy at both regional
      and national level;

10.   Cannot over-stress the fact that the EU has a profound interest in a stable, prosperous,
      open China which embraces democracy, free market principles, human rights and the rule
      of law, and that it must pursue policies which help China further endeavours in this
      direction;

11.   Notes that the dialogue between the EU and China on the rule of law, civil society and
      democracy is becoming increasingly intense; this dialogue should be accompanied by
      public and/or private initiatives and measures such as exchanges of schoolchildren and
      students, the setting up of contact groups of Members of Parliament and stronger cultural
      links;

12.   Stresses the importance of the successful experiences of the Hong Kong and Macao
      regional and special autonomies in widening and deepening cooperation between the EU
      and China in the political, cultural, economic and social fields;

13.   Calls on the Chinese government to facilitate the family reunion of children born on the
      mainland with their Hong Kong permanent resident parents, in accordance with the
      findings of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and the United
      Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;

Trade

14.   Congratulates China on its recent accession to the WTO, and expresses its support for the
      progress made so far in its economic and social reforms, but stresses that much greater
      progress on the application of the rule of law in China is essential to the full integration of
      China into the global market place;

15.   Is fully conscious that WTO accession marks a major development in China's relations
      with the rest of the world and that it will change both China's existing trading system and
      China itself; notes that the next few years will test the regime's capacity to adapt to a
      changing world on its own doorstep, but takes the view that economic progress can only
      succeed in tandem with political and social progress; expects China to give evidence that
      it is able to deal satisfactorily with the social and labour problems which will arise as a
      result of WTO accession; is convinced that in the longer term the EU, the US, Japan and

      other industrialised countries, working together with China, will have to develop and
      implement programmes in the rural and disadvantaged areas, outside the booming cities,
      to combat increasing inequalities and create educational opportunities for the majority of
      the Chinese population who live there;

16.   Recognises nonetheless that, despite improved economic prospects for many Chinese, this
      has not alleviated the need for more economic restructuring and a more even geographical
      spread of economic development to reduce the threat of even higher unemployment and
      social displacement in the future;

17.   Expresses its concern at the steady rise in the number of industrial disputes since 1998;
      urges the PRC to authorise the establishment of independent trade unions and to institute
      at the earliest opportunity a social protection system geared primarily towards the
      unemployed, whose numbers are set to swell as a result of China’s accession to the WTO;

18.   Notes the claim sometimes made by Community documents and officials that China's
      accession to the WTO is creating a dynamic economic environment in China and
      transforming its economy into an export-driven economy, but also realises that China's
      potential rests with a vast territory and a population where only the inhabitants of the
      richest areas located along the coast form a market, both characteristics of a 'continental
      economy' driven by internal demand, meaning that there is a need for the Chinese
      authorities to build up efficient internal cohesion policies;

19.   Is aware of the fact that with China's entry to the WTO, WTO rules and procedures will
      define a new context of economic and political relations of China with the US and EU
      (and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as well), and China will have to separate business
      from government, which will imply a serious change in the framing of economic
      development of China;

20.   Welcomes in this regard the cooperation agreements that the EU has with China in the
      field of social security, given the high level of unemployment already existing in China,
      which is likely to grow;

21.   Notes that China and the EU are already major trading partners and welcomes the
      continued growth in EU-China trade and the rising levels of EU direct investment in
      China; expects that the implementation by China of its terms of accession will contribute
      in a major way to reducing barriers to trade and investment, and entail a more balanced
      trading relationship;

22.   Notes that, while existing programmes such as the EU-China Scholarship 2000 Project
      Programme and the Junior Managers Project Programme between the EU and China to
      promote reciprocal exchanges in the field of technology and know-how have achieved
      some success, they must be stepped up;

23.   Notes that the strengthening of EU-China relations and the expansion of EU-China
      dialogue across the board render the existing EU-China trade and cooperation agreement
      largely obsolete, and calls on the Commission to bring forward proposals for an updated
      partnership agreement, in line with the development of a consistent and comprehensive
      EU common strategy towards China;

24.   Recognises China's leading role with the G77 countries and calls on the Chinese
      Government to fulfil this role within the WTO whilst respecting the legitimate economic
      concerns of neighbouring countries;

25.   Is seriously concerned about the high levels of pollution caused by China's industries and
      expects China to take serious measures to protect the environment; emphasises that Trade
      and the Environment is an essential component of the WTO agreement and urges the
      Chinese Government to play a full and positive role in promoting sustainable
      development, as required by the WTO agreement, both within China itself and globally;
      welcomes the general willingness of the Chinese Government to cooperate on
      environmental protection, and also the wide range of activities by the existing NGO
      community in this area; therefore calls on the Commission to ensure that sufficient
      support and know-how relating to environmental protection are channelled in China's
      direction; calls on the Chinese Government to continue and reinforce its dialogue and
      cooperation with the EU on global environmental issues, e.g. climate change;

Taiwan

26.   Is convinced that the EU's adherence to the one-China policy is directly linked to its
      commitment to a peaceful resolution of the dispute through negotiation, dialogue and
      confidence-building measures without any threat of force, and therefore cannot accept
      that China reserves the right to use military force in its disputes with Taiwan;

27.   Draws to the attention of both parties the indisputable fact that a peaceful resolution to the
      Taiwan question is crucial if political and economic stability in the region is to be
      reinforced and maintained in the medium- to long-term;

28.   Believes, in this regard, that the participation of Taiwan in ASEM could be a step forward
      as to the resumption of a genuine dialogue between Beijing and Taipei with a view to
      developing cross-Straits relations;

29.   Recognises the importance of the democratic process in Taiwan and takes note of the
      results of the December 2001 parliamentary elections; urges the two parties to engage in
      talks as soon as possible;

30.   Emphasises that any arrangement between China and Taiwan can only be achieved on a
      mutually acceptable basis; expresses the view that the future of cross-Straits relations will
      depend on both sides' willingness to demonstrate flexibility, and on their capacity to be
      imaginative in proposing steps to resume dialogue; takes the view that, given Taiwan's
      achievements as regards the establishment of a fully-fledged democratic system, social
      pluralism and the rule of law, the will and approval of the 23 million people in Taiwan
      must be respected and accounted for in the light of a hopefully peaceful solution between
      the parties;

31.   Deplores the fact that, in November 2001, the Member States did not grant visas for
      President Chen Shui-Bian to visit Europe; urges the Council and the Member States to
      honour their commitment to the fundamental rights of freedom to travel and issue visas to
      the President and all high-ranking officials of Taiwan for private visits to the European
      Union;

32.   Welcomes recent moves by the PRC towards cross-Straits ties and the wish expressed that
      direct mail services, trade, air and shipping links across the Straits be activated as soon as
      possible in order to promote all types of exchanges and other confidence-building
      measures;

33.   Notes that Taiwan eased restrictions on direct investment in the PRC in November 2001
      and plans to take further liberalisation steps from early 2002, including the introduction of
      direct trading links; notes, however, that Beijing has yet to respond to the move; urges the
      PRC to respond favourably, particularly in view of the implementation of China's and
      Chinese Taipei's commitments following their accession to the WTO and in the interests
      of improving cross-Straits relations;

34.   Urges the Commission to fulfil without delay its commitment to open an EU information
      office in Taipei;

Human rights

35.   Notes that China has signed and ratified the UN Covenants on Economic, Social and
      Cultural Rights and urges China to ratify as well the UN Covenant on Civil and Political
      Rights without delay;

36.   Endorses the human rights dialogue between the EU and China as a useful tool to engage
      China on this issue, but regrets that it has yet to lead to many tangible results and remains
      extremely concerned with the overall situation of human rights in China; consequently
      instructs its Human Rights Division to draw up an annual report on the development of
      human rights in China to be discussed by its competent committee, and instructs its
      competent committee to ensure that the Commission and the Council are properly
      represented and participate fully in the discussions on these reports;

37.   Urges the Commission and the Member States to exert a more effective control on
      products coming from China, making clear to the Chinese authorities that the EU can in
      no way accept products coming from forced labour camps; calls on China to put an end to
      this practice;

38.   Urges the Commission to propose at the next EU-China summit an increase in the number
      of joint ad hoc programmes aiming at fostering democracy and civil society, developing
      the rule of law and respect for human rights and supporting independent media;

39.   Expresses its indignation at the increasingly high number of executions in China, and at
      the links to the supply of body parts for human transplantation, and demands that the
      Chinese Government abolish the death penalty, declare a moratorium on the execution of
      persons already sentenced to death, and accelerate judicial reforms in order to eliminate
      the use of torture and the violation of human rights in the country; furthermore condemns
      the 'widespread and systemic use of torture against political dissidents, Tibetan activists,
      migrant workers, people accused of violating the one-child-per-family policy', and
      religious, social and ethnic minorities, as documented in a February 2001 report from
      Amnesty International;

40.     Notes with concern the strict rules imposed by the Chinese authorities on media and
        electronic communication; calls on the Chinese Government to lift the restrictions that
        limit citizens' access to the Internet;

41.     Calls on the Commission and the Council to ensure that, in all their dealings with the
        Chinese Government, it cooperates fully with the competent authorities within the EU and
        also within those countries, notably of the former Soviet Union, which serve as transit
        routes, in order to eliminate illegal migration of Chinese nationals towards the EU, not
        only to prevent all forms of human trafficking, exploitation and suffering, but also to
        eradicate criminal activity;

42.     Calls upon China to seize the opportunity of the Olympic Games of 2008 to abide by
        international human rights standards and to intensify general cooperation; calls for a
        monitoring procedure to be put in place to ensure that China honours its international
        obligations in the field of human rights in the run-up to this event; draws attention to the
        importance of preserving Beijing's architectural heritage while large-scale infrastructure
        projects are carried out ahead of the Olympic Games;

43.     Calls on the Chinese Government fully to recognise and respect fundamental social,
        cultural and political rights of religious, ethnic and other minorities as well as their
        cultural specificities, including the freedom of religious practice;

44.     Reiterates its view that greater economic freedom cannot yield lasting benefits without
        the concomitant fundamental human liberties and rights as laid down in the various UN
        covenants and other relevant international agreements and conventions, including those
        covering the protection of the global environment, which China has now signed;

45.     Urges China to respect its obligations as a signatory to the CITES convention and to pay
        more attention to cruel and inhumane treatment of animals;

Tibet

46.     Underlines the demand made in its abovementioned resolution of 15 December 1992
        concerning the autonomy of Tibet and invites the Chinese Government to accept the five-
        point plan of the Dalai Lama as a basis for negotiations on Tibet;

47.     As regards Tibet, is aware of a slight relaxation recently of religious restrictions on lower-
        level government employees, students and State company workers; however, notes that in
        both the regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, religious freedom continues to be severely
        restricted and people suspected of nationalist activities or sympathies are still subject to
        particularly harsh restrictions; is furthermore extremely preoccupied at the large number
        of nuns and monks who remain imprisoned and by the ongoing question of religious,
        political and cultural freedom; draws the attention of the Chinese Government to the
        importance of protecting the natural environment and the religious and cultural heritage
        of Tibet; appeals to the Chinese Government to respect and protect the religious and
        cultural identity of the people of Tibet;

48.     Welcomes, in this regard, the consistent stand of His Holiness the Dalai Lama as regards
        realising genuine self-government for Tibet within the People's Republic of China
        through peaceful negotiations, shares his grave concern at the systematic destruction of

      the Tibetan environment, traditions, culture and religion, at the ever-worsening political
      situation of the Tibetan people and at the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibet,
      and endorses his appeal for urgent international pressure on Beijing, as expressed in his
      address to the plenary session of the European Parliament of 24 October 2001; urges
      China, in this connection, to halt immediately the controversial plan of large-scale
      immigration to Tibet with regard, in particular, to the 20 000 people who are due to move
      into the Dulan region of Qinghai Province; calls on the Chinese Government to resume
      direct negotiations with His Holiness the Dalai Lama or his representatives without
      preconditions, with a view to defining a new, real statute of full autonomy for Tibet, with
      the only exceptions being foreign and defence policy;

49.   Reiterates its call to the Council to appoint an EU Special Representative for Tibetan
      Affairs so as to contribute effectively to the peaceful resolution of this issue, facilitating
      the resumption of negotiations and cooperating with the Tibetan Government in exile;

50.   Reiterates its call to the Commission, the Council, the Member States and the
      international community in general to give serious consideration to the possibility of
      recognising the Tibetan Government in exile as the legitimate representative of the
      Tibetan people if the Beijing authorities and the Tibetan Government in exile do not,
      through negotiations organised under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United
      Nations, sign an agreement on a new statute for Tibet;


                                                    o
                                                o       o


51.   Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the
      governments of the Member States, the Government of the People's Republic of China
      and the Chinese National People's Congress.

                                MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION

Resolution on the Communication from the Commission on a long term policy for
China-Europe relations (COM(95)0279 - C4-0288/95)


The European Parliament,

-    having regard to the Communication from the Commission on a long term policy for
     China-Europe relations (COM(95)0279 - C4-0288/95)),

-   having regard to the Council Conclusions on this Communication approved on                4
December     1995,

-    having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee, 1

-    having regard to the discussions between its Delegation for relations with the People's
     Republic of China and the Delegation of the National People's Congress,

-    having regard to its previous resolutions on China, Tibet, East Turkestan(Xinjiang),
     Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao,

-    having regard to its resolutions of 14 June 1995 on the communication from the
     Commission     'Towards a new Asia Strategy'2, and of 9 February 1994 on relations
     between the European Union and the People's Republic of China3 ,

-    having regard to the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence
     Policy and the opinion of the         Committee on External Economic Relations
     (A4-0198/97),


A.   whereas it is important for both the EU and China to have a cooperative rather than a
     confrontational relationship, developing mutual economic interests and encouraging
     China's fuller participation in dialogue based upon the principle of 'not just business as
     usual, but also politics as usual',

B.   whereas the effects of developments in China over the long term either on its population of
     1.2 billion, the EU or the world as a whole are unpredictable,

       2 OJ C 166, 3.7.1995, p. 64


       3 OJ C 61, 28.2.1994, p. 71




Fdr 319767                                   4                                PE 221.588/fin.

C.   whereas this relationship must be based on the objectives of the Common Foreign and
     Security Policy as laid down in the Treaty on European Union, which include the
     development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human
     rights and fundamental freedoms,

D.   whereas this can in no way be interpreted as an act of interference in Chinese
     domestic affairs but rather as a positive action in support of universal values on
     which common international institutions have been founded,

E.   whereas the EU signed a five-year Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the People's
     Republic of China which has been tacitly renewed from year to year since then; whereas an
     arms embargo, still in force, and diplomatic isolation followed the brutal suppression of the
     democracy movement in 1989,

F.   Noting the rapid rise in EU/China commerce and also the limitations caused by China's
     fragmented internal trade, regional inequality, protectionism, arbitrary tolls and transit fees
     and poor communications infrastructure,

G.   noting the results of the questionnaire of members of the Europe China Business
     Association 'Trading and Investing in China - China and the World Trade Organization'
     and its statement that 'China still has a long way to go to adopt commonly accepted
     practices of international trade, to open its markets, to allow foreign companies to operate
     freely and to create networks of distribution',

H.   having regard to the experience of the European Union in creating a single market of 370
     million people based on the harmonization of primarily commercial laws and standards,
     with resultant economic growth, its experience in assisting the adaptation to these
     standards of the former command economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the
     ex-Soviet Union, as well as the current development of a free trade area embracing 12
     Mediterranean countries with a resultant integrated market of some 700 million ,

I.   whereas, because of the size of China, the manner in which China's economy develops will
     have a decisive impact not only on the environment in China itself but on the environment
     in the whole world and, hence, also in Europe; whereas if China were to reach Western
     levels of consumption and pollution this would require a more equitable sharing of the
     global environmental space which would give China more and the West, including the EU,
     less room for exploitation and pollution than today,

J.   noting the political and economic policies which have, since 1978, transformed the internal
     and external position of China,

K.   whereas China's impressive economic growth in recent years is creating a need for gradual
     political and institutional reform regulating in a more democratic way the fundamental
     rights and duties of both citizens and the machinery of government,

L.   noting the reliance of China's rulers on the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in maintaining
     the political status quo; nevertheless recognizing that, through its pervasive financial,
     commercial and industrial operations, unique to China's 'socialist market economy', the

Fdr 319767                                     5                                 PE 221.588/fin.

     PLA has also become an agent and beneficiary of economic transition; noting also that the
     PLA will, owing to its concentration of power, impede the transition to a market economy
     and democracy until it relinquishes that role,

M. noting with disquiet the increases in Chinese defence spending, with the establishment of a
   blue-water navy and the modernization of its nuclear forces, increases which have
   encouraged higher defence spending throughout the region and increased risks of conflict,

N.   noting that in 1996 significant changes were made in China's legal system and that the
     revised Criminal Procedure Law which came into force on 1 January 1997 increases the
     protection for people detained under the criminal justice system and the Administrative
     Punishment Law which came into force on 1 October 1996 introduces some rights for
     people who may be subject to administrative detention; noting however that these laws fall
     short of international fair trial standards and are partly countered by other laws
     promulgated since the late 1980s, including the Martial Law adopted in 1996, which
     criminalize a broad range of activities seen as a threat to the established political, economic
     and social order,

O.   whereas widespread illegal practices by law enforcers, the lack of independence of the
     judiciary and the arbitrary application of law cause numerous human rights violations and
     although efforts are apparently being made to curb some of these practices, there is still
     serious cause for concern about the human rights situation in China,

P.   whereas, as a result of remaining legislation which conflicts with international standards
     and of the inadequate implementation of modernized laws, there are still serious and
     systematic human rights violations in China, with increasing and large-scale use of the
     death penalty even for minor crimes and with a large number of people detained for the
     peaceful expression of political or religious views, many in labour camps producing goods
     which may be exported to the EU, violating the provisions of the Generalized System of
     Preferences,

     the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva,

54. Resolves to monitor closely the situation in Hong Kong and Macao, given the international
    importance involved, after the handovers, and in particular the following points:
    - independence of the judiciary
    - rapid progress to elect the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special

                               EXPLANATORY STATEMENT


INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

The European Commission’s timely launch of a new Asia strategy in 1994 was followed by a
further communication dealing specifically with China in 1995. The EU Council of Ministers
has endorsed the “long-term policy for China-Europe relations”, and the present report gives the
European Parliament’s response, in the light of recent developments in and concerning China
based on the stated objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. These include the
preservation of peace, the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, and
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms (Treaty on European Union, Article J.1).
This explanatory statement examines some of the underlying issues.

There are two sides to the evolution of the EU’s relationship with China, which should reflect
cooperation rather than confrontation.       First, there is our engagement in the economic
development of that vast country, both externally through support for WTO membership, and
internally through investment, development programmes, cultural exchanges and the
encouragement of a civil society. Moreover, given the EU’s experience in welding together
the economies of 15 Member States into a Single Market and our current help in preparing
former Soviet bloc countries for accession to the EU and now extending cooperation to the
non-EU Mediterranean countries leading to a free market by 2010, EU expertise could
contribute significantly to remedying the deficiencies in China’s internal market.

Second, there is the integration of China into the world’s new political order as a major player,
not only in ensuring regional stability but also in a constructive international role through the
United Nations, the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), etc. The EU-China relationship must be
based on more than simple commercial links. China remains the outstanding example of a
territory where civil and political liberties began to develop and were ruthlessly suppressed.
Through its realistic dialogue with the National People’s Congress, and in other fora, the
European Parliament seeks the flowering of these liberties within a civil society, which may
help China to play a peaceful and constructive political role in the world. In short, the
European Parliament urges “Not just business as usual, but also politics as usual”.


ECONOMIC CHANGE AND POLITICAL SCLEROSIS

Achieving sustained growth and delivering prosperity are the primary aims of China’s leaders
through their ‘socialist market economy’. The current five year plan, approved in 1996, places
stability ahead of growth: President Jiang Zemin says “Without a stable political and social
environment, nothing can be done.”

China’s economy was described at a conference in Beijing in 1996 as “A pyramid of
interlocking monopolies directed by the state plan”. Beijing has backed away from selling off
China’s 100,000 mammoth state-owned enterprises, but permits increasingly decentralized
decision-making in the more efficient and has promoted foreign investment through tax
privileges and monopolies. These state enterprises employ about 110 million people and

Fdr 319767                                    14                               PE 221.588/fin.

provide housing, education and medical care to their workers who have no other safety net.
The pervasive role of the People’s Liberation Army in China’s economy is designed to ensure a
continuing role for the nomenklatura.         However, an increasing number of successful
privately-owned enterprises are transforming the country’s real economy. There are now over
600,000.

For over a decade China’s real GNP has grown by an average of about 9% per year and exports
recently by 17%. China now accounts for almost 4% of world merchandise trade and a
substantial share of global production. Including the increasingly integrated economies of
Taiwan and Hong Kong, the aggregate size of the Chinese economy is even more stunning.

Direct foreign investment may have peaked at some $40 billion in the mid-1990s, but will now
decline as tax free ‘recycling’ through Hong Kong ends. Investors are likely to remain
cautious until China complies more closely with international commercial and professional
standards. A series of reforms are in hand, including the proposed convertibility of the
currency and vigorous tariff reductions.

Overhauling an economy the size of China’s without significant social and political dislocations
seems unlikely. Much of the explosive growth and tax evasion is taking part in the richer parts
of coastal China. Local officials were unwilling to surrender power and money to a leadership
in Beijing that few expected to survive the post-Deng era.

The underdevelopment of its domestic capital markets, banking sector and financial services
could also hinder the country’s economic development. Another future problem is the shortage
of skilled labour. Corruption is endemic, as in other transitional economies.

Cultural clashes are likely to increase as China continues to open up to the world. The
international media are increasingly available.          While the Internet poses a real threat to
Beijing’s desire for information purity, it is difficult to control.

”China is a unitary state but in practice trade between provinces and localities is not absolutely
free”, says Edward Epstein, an academic economist and lawyer.       Comparisons may be drawn
with Europe before the creation of the Single Market. China is a unitary state within its
geographical borders, also some may say that it does not require universal competition and other
commercial laws. But the continued existence of internal barriers to trade needs to be tackled
firmly if commerce within China is to expand to its full potential.

Regional inequality, local protectionism, poor infrastructure and local government priorities
over central legislation from Beijing are the main obstacles to free trade within China.
Bottlenecks in transport alone already cost some 1% of GDP. A senior judge, Ren Jianxin, has
said “Local and departmental protectionism.....[has] seriously tarnished the image of
law-enforcement organs and seriously hampered the healthy development of the socialist market
economy”. Jeffrey D. Sachs, an academic pioneer in Central Europe’s transition to market
economies, says that, it is “likely... [that] the regional income inequality will widen rather than
narrow in the years ahead”. While the current five year plan includes renewed efforts by the
central government to make internal trade more fairly balanced, some are driven by WTO
requirements for ‘national treatment’.

The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) regulates and enforces China’s
anti-trust laws. Although it can fine, there is no legal penalty for non-compliance with SAIC
rulings. Edward Epstein writes: ”Although the resurrection of provisions against government
interference in the market is encouraging they have been diluted and remain impractical to
enforce”.

Trade barriers and protectionism continue, such as the ban by Guizhou province on the import
of bicycles, televisions and refrigerators from other regions in China. Arbitrary tolls and
transit fees levied by local government officials are commonplace. In a recent article, the
People’s Daily admits, “Some regions have formed enclosed markets, set up blockades, limited
trade and used some abnormal or even unreasonable means to interfere in normal trading and
market activities”.

While personal freedom of movement has improved and passes for work in other provinces are
more available, the lack of mobility of housing permits is a fundamental obstacle. Moreover,
while official policy encourages the economy to ‘Go West’, most migrant workers are
struggling to ‘Go East’.

Continued economic development is likely to lead to political changes. How rapidly these
come about, how abrupt or violent they are and whether they will necessarily lead to
improvements in human rights cannot be forecast with any certainty.

The opportunity for the European Union to assist in China’s growth does not come only from
commercial investment. The experience of creating a Single Market in Europe should be
offered to Beijing. According to a November 1996 report from the European Commission, in
the period 1987 - 1993, the EU’s GDP was 1.1 - 1.5% higher than it would have been without
reform, and up to 900,000 jobs were created. In the longer term, lifting internal barriers should
increase trade volumes by 20 - 30 %. Intra-EU investment has risen sevenfold between 1985
and 1993. The Single Market programme was initiated by the European Parliament: the
National People’s Congress should examine its potential for China.


HUMAN RIGHTS

Human rights issues play a key role in determining policies towards China.

Criticism of China for human rights abuses seems to provoke a hostile and xenophobic response
from China’s regime. It has sought to promote an alternative ‘Asian View’ of human rights in
the interest of its own legitimacy and power. Lamentably, some governments have accepted
and promoted these arguments in the pursuit of their economic and other interests.

In 1993 President Clinton ‘delinked’ Beijing’s human rights record from the annual decision of
whether to grant China most-favoured-nation trading status. Attempts to deny this status had
not only made China more recalcitrant but also threatened to hurt US business in China. By
reinforcing trade ties, the Administration argued, the US would be in a better position to
influence China on human rights.

Wei Jingsheng's continued imprisonment and the sentencing of Wang Dan to 11 years
imprisonment in October 1996 are symbolic of increased repression and growing official
paranoia about any form of dissent. Wang Dan was found guilty of ‘conspiring to subvert the
government’ by writing articles criticizing the government which were published overseas and
having contacts with Chinese exile organizations and with other dissidents in China.
Independent observers were excluded from the hearing.

The dissident movement in China has disintegrated after the harsh crackdown on the Tiananmen
activists. Its leaders were forced either to flee the country or spend time in jail. Many former
Chinese dissidents have slipped into inoffensive academic jobs, while others have chosen to
pursue wealth, either in China’s percolating economy or abroad.

The policy pursued by China in Tibet is rightly criticized by most international observers. In
summary, this includes saturation of the territory with Han Chinese, bullying of the religious,
cynical creation of an alternative Panchen Lama, repression of any political or cultural dissent,
environmental damage and a feudal attitude of the Chinese towards Tibetans.            Beijing’s
repressive treatment of the indigenous people of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, although not
witnessed at first hand by your rapporteur, is creating renewed tension.

The human rights issue is probably the most complex which the EU must tackle in its relations
with China. In upholding the Maastricht Treaty criteria, the twice-yearly dialogue on human
rights between Beijing and the EU ‘troika’ is only a part of what must become a realistic and
frank debate.


DEMOCRATIZATION AND POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION

The establishment of pluralism and the rule of law would make China much more stable.        The
reconciliation of market freedoms with central political control is impossible.

Most of the Chinese masses are currently more interested in a higher standard of living than in
profound political reform. They want the Internet, not the Internationale. However, the
factors that stimulated the outbreak of discontent in the spring of 1989 are even more present in
China today.

Instability on the largest scale could occur in the countryside, away from the booming cities and
coastal provinces. The 800 million rural workers who live in the hinterland were the first to
benefit from Deng’s liberalization in 1978, but now they harbour a feeling of shiluogan, being
left out. Frustrated on the land, many are moving to the cities. Beijing alone shelters more
than 3 million ‘drifters’. The national total for this floating population is expected to rise to
200 million over the next five years.

Despite these problems positive developments are being made in the Chinese countryside with
an experiment in village democracy, in which the EU is involved. There are around 900,000
villages in China. Since 1988, over 80% of them have elected, through universal suffrage and
secret ballots, their own chiefs and village committees, who serve for terms of three years.




Fdr 319767                                    17                               PE 221.588/fin.

Most of the elected village heads are not Communist Party members. For China as a whole,
village democracy marked the party’s most sweeping abdication of power since the People’s
Republic was founded in 1949.

There are other signs of incipient political liberalization in China. The National People’s
Congress (NPC) has a well deserved reputation of compliance with Party edicts, but is now
developing a mind of its own. The first real sign of this came in 1992, when the NPC - which
has 3,000 delegates, only 60-70% of them party members - registered a strong note of protest
against plans to build the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtse River. In addition to concerns
about the huge environmental and human costs, many were anxious that it would suck
investment away from their own regions. 841 delegates abstained or voted against the plan.

The role of the EU in China’s democratization must be to support the election of chiefs in larger
urban environments. In addition, backing of the NPC in its attempts to play a more significant
political role, coupled with the development of pluralism, would be a positive step.


LAND AND ENERGY RESOURCES

China faces serious environmental problems. Only about 20% of industrial waste and 15% of
sewage flowing into China’s rivers is treated. The very shortage of fresh water is becoming
critical. There is heavy reliance on coal, with consequent emissions of carbon and sulphur.
The Chinese Government has made some efforts since the early 1980s to reduce environmental
damage, but given the prospect of rapid industrialization, a tripling of power generation and a
doubling of car ownership by the end of this century, the environmental impact will be severe.

Population growth will have a profound effect. Many now flout the ‘one-child family’ policy
and China’s total population reached 1.2 billion in the second week of February 1995, five years
ahead of China’s optimistic planning. An ageing population will also have a bearing on
China’s growth trajectory.

Food supply methods must change in the future. China has 22% of the world’s population but
only 9% of usable land. Some 1.1 million hectares of grainland were lost annually from 1990
to 1994 to industrial sites and other uses. The Chinese used to eat little but rice and wheat;
they now buy pork and chicken, and much more beer than before, requiring a disproportionate
use of grain. Although the world’s largest grain producer, China has emerged as the second
ranking grain importer, after Japan. Some studies suggest that by the next generation China
will need to import the entire current world production.

Recent land reforms in 18 provinces granting some tenants formal tenure of up to 100 years
have increased production, but only complete freehold would ensure maximum productivity and
investment. A recent survey of farmers showed 63% did not know the duration of their land
rights, but 79% would favour a policy of perpetual land use rights (Scientific American ‘Can
China Feed Itself?’, November 1996).

China’s energy-intensive economic growth has also created serious environmental concerns.
For the period 1971-1992 actual demand for energy increased from 236 million tons to 710



Fdr 319767                                    18                               PE 221.588/fin.

millions tons of energy. It is also predicted that Chinese oil demand will rise from the current
3.3 million
barrels per day to nearly 7 million barrels per day by 2010.

Nuclear power is seen as the paramount way to close the country’s growing energy gap, which
is aggravated by stagnant oil output and bottlenecks in coal transportation.

China faces many more than just environmental dilemmas in its rush toward economic
development. Once completed, the Three Gorges Dam will create a 410-mile long reservoir
and submerge 150,000 acres of forest and farmland. Erected to control seasonal flooding and
harness hydroelectric power, the dam is projected to produce 85 billion kilowatt-hours of
electricity each year. Construction of the project will force the resettlement of 1.3 million
Chinese in 17 counties of Sichuan and Hubei provinces.

It is crucial, however, not to consider the destruction of China’s environment as a fait accompli.
  Technology and techniques exist which could save China from many mistakes which have
already been made in the West. The EU’s expertise in environmental technologies, now being
applied in the former Soviet bloc, must play a role.


FOREIGN RELATIONS AND SECURITY

While the nations of the West are coming to terms with the major role which China may play on
the world stage in the coming years, China’s people in certain respects are becoming
increasingly inward-looking.      Beijing is countering domestic problems by appealing to
nationalism.

Beijing’s attitudes to foreign affairs are based on different principles from those of most
Western nations, resulting partly on her history of seclusion and partly on the undoubted
exploitation by others. For example, multinational humanitarian efforts and the rationale for
international intervention in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti are alien to Chinese thinking.

By engaging China and encouraging its participation in multilateral fora and
confidence-building regimes, the European Union over the long term may help soften China’s
scepticism about multilateral institutions, which could help stabilize East Asia.

The emphasis of ASEAN governments’ China policy is primarily on developing economic
relations. However, recent Chinese behaviour on the Paracel and Spratly Islands and towards
Taiwan has raised regional concern that a tougher line towards Beijing may be required. The
attitudes of ASEAN governments to China have historically been determined by two factors:
geography and ethnicity. China’s growing military and economic capacity confronts the
ASEAN countries with a dilemma: whether to try to counter China with strategic alliances
among themselves and with stronger Asian powers, notably Japan, or whether to seek
accommodation with China even if that involves acceptance of a degree of Chinese hegemony.

It is likely that both China and Taiwan will remain committed to eventual reunification. Trade
interests are considerable, with Taiwan having approximately $29 billion of investment on the
mainland. The fall in the Taipei stock exchange after the recent PRC missile exercises testifies

Fdr 319767                                     19                               PE 221.588/fin.

to the danger of even limited threats. Washington’s deployment of two carrier battle groups to
the area at that time and support for this action throughout the free world sent a long-term signal
to any hyper-nationalists in Beijing.

Sino-American nations are paramount in the future stability of the region and must be reflected
in any EU-China policy. Unilateral initiatives by EU Member States should be judged in this
wider context. By remaining engaged in the region, the United States will improve the odds
that China’s next generation of leaders will be moderate at home and abroad. Currently, both
Beijing and Washington seem keen to demonstrate that their relations, which have been strained
and verging on bad, are starting to improve.

China’s security analysts anticipate and fear Japan’s renaissance as a world-class military
power. They are particularly afraid of a fundamental change in the US-Japan alliance. If this
comes under strain or undergoes a transformation in which Japan assumes a much more
prominent military role then, the Beijing hawks could accelerate militarization.

China’s military expansion must also be of serious concern to the EU. China is certainly
modernizing its armed forces and is acquiring a blue water navy. Official statistics show a
12.7% increase in defence spending in 1996 - a process encouraged by the Gulf War, which
showed China’s technological deficiencies. Chinese military officials believe the present gap in
their capabilities is temporary and their long-term goal is to be a global military peer of the US.
Fears of an increased Chinese military capacity, with longer distance capability, has been one
factor in a rise in arms spending elsewhere in East and South-East Asia, notably in Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan.

In June 1989, in the aftermath of the Tiananmen killings, the European Union suspended all
military cooperation with China and imposed an embargo on any trade in arms on the part of the
Member States. This embargo has not been lifted. There is, however, evidence that it is
being flouted by more than one Member State. It is the Member States themselves, of course,
who are responsible for implementing and policing the embargo.

In the light of both continued human rights abuse (the original reason for the imposition of the
embargo) and aggressive Chinese behaviour in the region (against Taiwan in 1996, against the
Philippines over Mischief Reef, against Vietnam with oil exploration in disputed waters, for
example), the embargo should be maintained - and enforced.

Hong Kong's and to some extent Macao’s reversion to China must also influence future EU
policy toward China. Hong Kong, whose bilateral trade with the EU is worth some 40 billion
ecu, has a population of 6 million yet produces 23% of China’s wealth and so far has enjoyed
100% of China’s democracy. Whereas the 1995 Legislative Council was elected through
universal adult suffrage, only 400 selected Hong Kong citizens were allowed to cast a vote for
Tung Chee-Hwa, China’s first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region. The Provisional legislature had already announced its intention to revoke more than
20 civil rights and other laws by the spring of 1997.

China’s relations with other countries in the region are also relevant in considering an EU-China
policy. In 1996, China and Russia signed an agreement on frontier disputes and declared their
‘strategic alliance’. Also in 1996, India signed an agreement for confidence-building measures

Fdr 319767                                     20                               PE 221.588/fin.

despite China’s export of nuclear technology to Pakistan and support for the Pakistani position
on Kashmir.

The peace and prosperity of the world in the next century depend in many ways on what Beijing
does and also on the way in which the outside world handles it. The role of the EU and its
Member States in this process should not be underestimated.

OPINION
(Rule 147)

for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy

on a Communication from the Commission concerning a long-term policy for China-Europe
relations (COM(95)0279 - C4-0288/95; report by Mr McMillan-Scott)

Committee on External Economic Relations

Draftsman: Mr Michael Hindley



PROCEDURE

At its meeting of 7 September 1996 the Committee on External Economic Relations appointed
Mr Hindley draftsman.

It considered the draft opinion at its meetings of 18 December 1996, 18 March 1997, 16 April
1997 and 13 May 1997.

At the last meeting it adopted the following conclusions unanimously.

The following were present for the vote: Castellina, chairman; Hindley, draftsman; Elchlepp,
Malerba (for Parodi), Erika Mann, Miranda de Lage, Porto, Schwaiger, Valdivielso de Cué and
Van der Waal (for Souchet).


BACKGROUND

China's importance for Europe is more and more vital in all fields.

-   Global and regional security interests including adherence to the treaties governing nuclear
    and other weapons proliferation, an international drive to contain arms sales and
    encouragement of Chinese domestic, pulicidal, economic and social reforms in the interests
    of its people (20 % of all people alive on the globe today);

-   Common interest in global issues: engagement in dialogue and cooperation towards
    sustainable development and for the protection of the environment, the information society,
    demographic growth, poverty, détente, the preservation of forests, the problem of illegal
    immigration, and the control and eradication of disease, drugs and crime;
-   Global economic stability: China's size and influence on world trade give its economic
    policy global significance. China must take its place as a major player in the world

Fdr 319767                                     22                             PE 221.588/fin.

     system of economic rules and policies and it is essential to help it to participate fully in the
     rules-based system of the World Trade Organization;

-    Competitiveness of European industries.       We must be present on the world's most
     dynamic markets and China is already the Union's fourth largest market and fourth largest
     supplier. China's market could become the largest in the world in many important sectors
     (telecommunications, aircraft, computers, energy).

I.   The rise of a major new economic power

-    A booming economy. GNP growth rates reached around 9 % during the 1980s and 12 to
     13% in the last three years, with industrial output and investment growing at a rate of over
     20 % for several years. EU-China trade has increased more than fourteenfold since the
     beginning of reform in China. But EU exports have not kept pace with imports. The
     EU's trade surplus of the mid-1980s turned into a bilateral trade deficit, which has remained
     in the 8-10 billion ECU range in the last four years. However, this is dwarfed by the US
     trade deficit with China and the proportion of EU imports covered by exports (55 %) is
     much higher than that of the US (26 % in 1993). Moreover, the EU share in total Chinese
     imports grew from 11 % to 15 % in the first half of this decade, a better export performance
     than that of the US in the Chinese market (rising slowly to 12 %) but less than that of Japan
     (22 %). Indeed, the EU share in China is higher than that enjoyed by the Union in other
     parts of the Asian region. The picture in the field of direct investment, one of the crucial
     elements in China's reforms, is less bright for Europe. The EU share in total FDI in China
     (around 4 %) remains far lower that its share in other emerging markets. EU companies
     are lagging well behind not only Hong Kong and other overseas Chinese companies, but
     also US and Japanese ones. EU (15) companies invested a total of 2.5 billion dollars in
     some 3 000 projects. This represents less than half the investment of either US or
     Japanese companies. Although the average size of EU projects tends to be bigger than
     that of its competitors and some of them are the undisputed leaders in key sectors of
     China's industry (such as automobiles, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals) there is a
     perception in the Chinese, European and foreign business communities that EU companies
     are less dynamic than their competitors in the Chinese market and are hence missing
     opportunities. This could have negative implications for future trade and weaken the EU's
     global competitiveness.

-    China should become a full member of the World Trade Organization

     According to the EU the key remaining issues are:

     = Commitments in the field of import tariffs. China should be ready to envisage binding
       its duties at levels which, at the end of an implementation period, would result in an
       average tariff not higher than about twice the OECD average;

     = Commitments in the field of traded services; such commitments should not be
       undermined by geographical limitations, access specifications or other restrictions;




Fdr 319767                                      23                                PE 221.588/fin.

     = The liberalization of the foreign trade monopoly: the automatic right of individuals to
       engage in direct import or export trade in all products is a basic feature of the WTO
       system, but does not yet exist in China;
     = Adherence by China to the Tokyo Round civil aviation agreement and the agreement on
       government procurement;

     = Elimination by China of all WTO-inconsistent quotas, quantitative restrictions, and
       non-tariff barriers.

-    Bilateral trade discussions with the EU

     Bilateral trade talks since 1992 have had three interrelated objectives: promoting China's
     economic and trade reforms, helping China into the multilateral trade system, and
     achieving better market access for European goods and services. This dialogue was
     institutionalised in 1993 by an Economic and Trade Working Group. 1994 saw detailed,
     sectorial meetings on intellectual property rights, agriculture and financial services.

II. New long-term strategy

1.   Development of trade

     The European Union's constructive engagement in China is twofold: facilitating
     development of EU-China trade and assisting China in its economic and social reforms.
     The EU has much to offer to help China's difficult process of transition through exchanges
     of experience and information about China's move towards sustainable growth. Success
     in negotiating sectoral agreements (on maritime transport and intellectual property, for
     example) and in opening markets can bring great benefits to companies and exporters
     across the EU. The European Union also plays a leading role in the negotiations on
     China's accession to the World Trade Organisation, believing that membership of the WTO
     will cement and accelerate economic reform in China.

2.   A strategy to promote a civil society

     The European Union believes China's internal stability is a matter of regional and global
     importance. The EU is working with China to support reforms in both society and the
     economy. Conscious that this process will inevitably take time, the EU believes it is
     important to support efforts in China to create a civil society based on respect for human
     rights and the rule of law. Our assessment is that progress can best be achieved through
     such a positive, pragmatic approach.

3.   A strategy to combat poverty

     The EU shares the overriding concern of the Chinese Government to feed its population
     and make the best use of its natural resources. That is why it is assisting China's efforts to
     promote agricultural technology and to reduce environmental damage and rural poverty.
     EU cooperation with China will focus on specific provinces under environmental and
     social pressure. The EU supports China's effort to bring about economic reform in the

     rural sector, coupled with measures to promote environmental conservation and sustainable
     agricultural practices.

4.. A strategy to promote environmental protection and sustainable development

     The European Union wishes to cooperate with China in promoting sustainable
     development, protecting the environment and sustaining global resources. The Chinese
     authorities have recently introduced a number of reforms in line with the broad principles
     agreed at the 1992 UN World Conference on Environmental and Development in Rio.
     The European Union is prepared to offer support to China with improving environmental
     protection and limiting the negative impact of industrial growth and urbanisation.



III. Two political problems always remain in the background of EU/China relations


1.   Human rights

     The importance attached to human rights has been a consistent feature of the EU's policy
     towards China. Immediately after the Tiananmen Square events in June 1989, the EU
     imposed a number of sanctions which have been only gradually relaxed (a ban on arms
     sales is still in place). Parliament has passed a number of resolutions on China and senior
     European Ministers and Commissioners consistently raise human rights when they meet
     their Chinese opposite numbers. In order to achieve maximum effectiveness, public
     statements have been reinforced by detailed discussions in private. the EU puts particular
     stress on the involvement of the international community through the UN Commission on
     Human Rights.

2.   Hong Kong and Macao

     The Commission's Office in Hong Kong responsible for relations with Hong Kong and
     Macao opened in 1993, and China has agreed that it will continue to operate as an
     independent entity after transfer of sovereignty. Equally, there will be no change in the
     functioning of the 1992 trade and cooperation agreement with Macao. Relations within
     the WTO will continue, since Hong Kong and Macao both participate autonomously.
     Cooperation is already developing bilaterally on customs, standards, culture, university and
     business links. But the EU will also seek to take advantage of the particular opportunities
     offered by closer relations in the years to come:

     - both territories have important roles to play as gateways to other regions of China, and
       can act as key facilitators for increased European trade and investment with China;

     - the traditions of free trade and internationalism established by Hong Kong and Macao
       could serve as important examples for China and in the region as a whole, and suggest a
       continuing role for the territories as partners for the EU as the new WTO dialogue
       develops in the years to come.

CONCLUSIONS

The Committee on External Economic Relations:

1.   Recognizes that China is playing a more and more important part in all areas of
     international trade;

2.   Stresses the common interest for Europe and China of global issues such as sustainable
     development, protection of the environment and management of global resources;

3.   Is conscious of the dynamism of China's economy, China being already the Union's fourth
     largest market and fourth largest supplier, and is concerned at the EU's growing trade
     deficit with China;

4.   Stresses the need to develop EU investment in China to balance investment by the United
     States, overseas Chinese and Japan;

5.   Approves the interrelated objectives resulting from trade talks since 1992: promoting
     China's economic and trade reforms, helping China into the multilateral trade system, and
     achieving better market access for European goods and services;

6.   Urges the EU and China to find, in a climate of mutual respect, a level at which they can
     agree on the question of human rights,

7.   Stresses that the EU has a single human rights policy and that the political or economic
     boycotting of one Member State is regarded as action taken against the EU as a whole;

8.   Recalls the particular interest of the EU in Hong Kong and Macao and stresses the
     importance of these territories as gateways to the rest of China and that of maintaining an
     EU presence in these two places;

9.   Urges early membership of the WTO for China, but stresses that China must undertake
     before it joins the WTO to remove all obstacles in the fields of trade and investment;

10. Stresses the importance of Chinese membership of WTO;

11. Approves the new strategy proposed by the Commission

     -   to help business in China,
     -   to promote a civil society,
     -   to help relieve poverty,
     -   to promote environmental protection and sustainable development;

12. Approves the Commission's proposals.
